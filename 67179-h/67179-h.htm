</div>


<p>“You have bags of gold, and do you refuse to give me
just a little?”</p>

<p>“Not one cent.”</p>

<p>“I helped you to earn that money.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you refuse to give me any, and you are going
away?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to give you any and I am going away.”</p>

<p>The above dialogue occurred in a room on the top floor
of a great tenement house, and a strangely picturesque
scene was presented. An old man with frowzy hair, and
deep-set eyes illuminating a dark and wrinkled face, sat by
a table. Opposite to the old man was a bright-faced lad
of thirteen or fourteen. The furnishings of the room were
reasonably comfortable and on the table burned a flickering
candle. Indeed the whole scene was weird and strange in
the extreme.</p>

<p>The lad was kneeling on a stool and his elbows were
resting on the table, and there was a serious and earnest
look upon his bright face; and the shadow deepened when
the old man repeated:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going away and I refuse to give you anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Are you treating me right?” asked the lad, in a wistful
tone of entreaty.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No, you are not. I have worked hard. I am penniless;
I am but a boy, you are rich. You do not mean to
leave me penniless?”</p>

<p>“All that you say is true. You did help me to earn the
money; you did serve me well; but I have repaid you in
full. I owe you nothing.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“You have been my pupil; you excel your master; you
are the most wonderful trick ventriloquist in the world;
you will have no trouble in earning money; you can make
a fortune greater than mine; you were an apt pupil. You
have a better chance than I, lad, and you owe all to me.
I have supported you well; I have educated you. You
speak three different languages, and the man does not live
in the world who can excel you as a magician or a ventriloquist.
Your education and your talents are your fortune.”</p>

<p>“But you should give me a little money.”</p>

<p>“No, I need it all. Yes, I have worked hard, I have
saved my money. I need it all, yes, all, for purposes of
revenge.”</p>

<p>A moment the lad was silent and thoughtful, but at
length he said:</p>

<p>“You promised some day to tell me about myself. You
are not my father. You have told me you were in no way
related to me. Who am I? What am I? Who were my
parents? Where are they? You told me some day I
should know all.”</p>

<p>“You shall.”</p>

<p>“Good; tell me now.”</p>

<p>“No, not now; some day I will tell you all. You were
born in India; your parents are dead; you have relatives<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
living. It would be of no advantage to you now to know
who your relatives are; some day it may be. I will watch;
if that day come you shall know all. It will be of no
advantage to you to know now.”</p>

<p>“And you refuse to tell me?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me my real name?”</p>

<p>“Your real name is Isaac. You bear my last name
Andro. It is a good name and will serve you for the
present. The name you have is Nimble Ike, for you are
the most nimble lad in the world. I have been very careful
in your instruction; the lad does not live who in every
way is as accomplished as yourself.”</p>

<p>“And yet I will be penniless.”</p>

<p>“Not long will you be penniless with your talents and
your experience. Remember how much you have seen of
the world; remember how great has been your experience.
You have visited with me every city and town of any importance
in the United States. Few middle-aged men have
had your experience. You are less than fourteen to-day
and possess the experience and knowledge of most men of
forty. You are a wonderful lad; you need never want for
food or money.”</p>

<p>“And is that all you will tell me about myself?”</p>

<p>“All at present.”</p>

<p>“But we may never meet again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will meet some day, and here is a little
box. Do not open it; in fact you can only open it by
smashing it, but if at any time you are sick and helpless
open the box. On your honor do not open it unless, as I
say, you are sick and helpless and starving. Obey me and
all will be well; disobey me and trouble will overtake you.
Never lose the box. String it around your neck as a charm
and some day it may be of benefit to you; but the best I
can wish you is that you never have occasion to smash the
box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>The old man spoke the last words in a very solemn,
warning tone, and then handed a tiny little box to our hero,
that could readily be strung over his heart, as a talisman,
without any inconvenience.</p>

<p>“When do you go?” asked the lad.</p>

<p>“I will bid you good-by some day this week.”</p>

<p>“How about the things here in this room?”</p>

<p>“They are yours, and the rent is paid for three months.
Yes, the furniture is yours.”</p>

<p>“Then you do give me something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but no money. I need the money; but some day
we will meet again and then I may have a wonderful revelation
to make to you.”</p>

<p>“Will you leave me your address?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I have my own reasons for disappearing and leaving no
trace behind.”</p>

<p>“But will you know whether I am alive or dead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I have read the future. You will flourish all
right, but remember one thing: remain honest; cheat no
man; lie to no man; and remember that while you are at
present only a showman that some day you may be a gentleman,
and then your record will tell for or against you.”</p>

<p>A little later and Ike retired to his bed. The little
box had been strung around his neck, and his thoughts
were centered on its contents, and despite the strong prohibition
he felt an especially strong desire to open it. In
fact he argued audibly:</p>

<p>“I have not been treated fairly. I have a right to open
the box. Hang me, I will open it.”</p>

<p>With this resolve in his mind the lad rose from his bed
slyly and searched around for something wherewith to
smash the box. He found a heavy spike; and then it
occurred to him that the noise might awaken the old<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
magician, and he hesitated. Finally he remembered he
had a strong knife in his pocket. He could pry the box
open. He drew the knife from his pocket and made an
attempt to pry open the lid when suddenly he felt a cold
hand on his cheek. He turned and beheld a figure in
white standing before him, and the figure spoke, saying:</p>

<p>“Remember your promise.”</p>

<p>Ike was a lad of extraordinary nerve. He had speculated
in surprises all his life as the assistant of the necromancer.
He had worked all manner of surprises, and
therefore was less likely to be overcome by a sudden apparition.
He demanded:</p>

<p>“What promise?”</p>

<p>“You promised not to open the box.”</p>

<p>The lad recalled that he had made such a promise and
the figure spoke again and said:</p>

<p>“It is a test of honor. If you open that box you are
without honor.”</p>

<p>The lad at once exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I will not open the box; or, only under the conditions
named.”</p>

<p>The figure disappeared and&mdash;well, the lad started up in
bed. He had only dreamed. Then he closed his eyes and
dropped off into sleep. He had about resolved to open the
box, and thus had come to him a dream. He made sure
that he had been dreaming and then said:</p>

<p>“I renew my promise. I will not open the box. I
will keep the promise I made when awake and the promise
I made in my dream.”</p>

<p>The lad awoke at his usual hour and after dressing
entered the room where the old magician usually slept on
a mattress placed on the floor. The old man was not there
and the lad muttered:</p>

<p>“How strange! Uncle Andro does not go out before
breakfast as a rule.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>The boy stood gazing around the room when his glance
fell upon a note lying on the table. He seized the note
and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will not see me again until fate has done its best
or worst. Make no inquiry for me. I have left one
dollar for you. All else in the rooms is yours, as I told
you. Good-by until we meet again at the command of
fate.</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-left:5em">“<span class="smcap">Uncle Andro.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“He has deserted me,” said Ike in a low, sad tone. “Yes,
he has deserted me. I did not think he would go away
and not say good-by. He intended to steal away when he
was talking to me last night. I cannot help it, and I will
not complain. I am but a boy, but I have had a large
experience. I can work tricks better than my master. I
will get along well enough; but I would like to know what
he meant all these years when he continually alluded to
fate as connected with me. Hang fate! I am going to
strike in for myself.”</p>

<p>The lad placed the note on the table and as he did so he
espied a neatly folded bill. He unfolded it and found it
was a “fiver,” as the boys say.</p>

<p>“Well, he did leave me enough for a meal.”</p>

<p>There was enough in the rooms for several meals and Ike
prepared his breakfast&mdash;he had been accustomed to so
doing. He was a resolute lad, and we will here state that
there are many resolute lads to-day struggling against
adverse fate, and they are doing it cheerfully and without
complaint.</p>

<p>We will make one more statement; some of our friends
have often said to us:</p>

<p>“It is wonderful how you can make up all the incidents
in your stories.” We answer upon these occasions, that
more incidents, strange and wonderful, are occurring
every day than the most imaginative author could conceive<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
in a month&mdash;incidents far stranger than go upon record;
and we are not compelled to “make up” incidents, simply
because “fact is stranger than fiction,” and we have more
incidents and actual occurrences in our note-book than we
can ever relate.</p>

<p>Ike finished his meal and then lay down on old Andro’s
mattress to think over the past and study the future.
At length, however, he determined to go forth. There was
no need for him to look over his possessions; he knew every
article in that room and its value thoroughly, and he had
a five-dollar bill. He started to go down the stairs, and on
the floor below the one he and old Andro had occupied for
over a year he saw a little girl come from a room. The
child was very pretty and had been weeping. Ike was a
tender-hearted, sympathetic fellow. He had never seen
the child before, but upon beholding that she had been
weeping his curiosity was aroused. Once more, dear
reader, how often do we meet people who invite our sympathies
in great cities. I can say one on about every
square mile as we walk the streets.</p>

<p>The little girl preceded our hero down the stairs, for he
had stepped aside to permit her to do so, and when she
reached the street he followed her. She walked along at a
slow pace and several times Ike could hear her sob, and
beheld her little delicate frame quiver with emotion; he
could not stand it and he ran up and accosted the girl, saying
“Good-morning.”</p>

<p>The child started back in an affrighted manner.</p>

<p>“You are crying,” said Ike, in a very kindly tone, “can
I aid you?”</p>

<p>The child fixed her blue eyes upon him, and, after a
moment, in a low tone, answered:</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I can?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know I can’t help you?”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how you know it?”</p>

<p>“Because I want money; you can’t give me money.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, how can you?”</p>

<p>“Easy enough; how much money do you want?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mamma told me to go out and ask for
money.”</p>

<p>The girl was not over ten years of age.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know how much money you need?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Will five dollars do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I can give you five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Why should you give me five dollars?”</p>

<p>“Because you need it; that is a good reason, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Will you come and see my mamma and tell her? She
knows how much money we need.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go and see your mamma.”</p>

<p>“Come.”</p>

<p>The girl led the way back and our hero accompanied
her; they ascended to the room from whence Ike had seen
the girl issue and entered, the girl still leading the way.
Ike beheld at a glance that it was the home of need; on a
bed lay a woman, possibly she had once been comely looking,
but she did not look pretty as the boy beheld her.
She was evidently quite ill and her complexion was the
color of saffron.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said the little girl, “here is a good boy, who
says he will give us five dollars. Is that enough?”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes bulged in their sunken sockets, and
she asked:</p>

<p>“Who is the boy?”</p>

<p>“I think he is the boy who lives with the strange old
man overhead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>Ike stepped beside the bed and said:</p>

<p>“Madam, I have got five dollars to which you are welcome
if it will be of any service to you.”</p>

<p>The woman just glared but remained silent.</p>

<p>Ike pulled the money from his pocket and proffered it
to the invalid, who, for the first time spoke, and asked:</p>

<p>“Why should you give me five dollars?”</p>

<p>“Because you need it.”</p>

<p>“But can you spare it?”</p>

<p>“I do not need it as much as you do,” was the startling
and really suggestive answer.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Isaac Andro.”</p>

<p>“And you propose to give me five dollars?”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Ike, and he tendered the money.</p>

<p>“I cannot take it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You cannot afford to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can.”</p>

<p>“Have you plenty of money?”</p>

<p>“That’s all I’ve got.”</p>

<p>“That is all you have?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you offer it to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How strange; why should you?”</p>

<p>“I told you why; you need it more than I do.”</p>

<p>“I do need it, but I will not take it from you, no, no;
you can give us a few cents, enough to buy a loaf of bread,
but I will not take the five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Do you need something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said the woman, “we have not had a mouthful
pass our lips in twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Ike, “why, I’ve got lots of food
upstairs, I’ll go and get some,” and without waiting for<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
remonstrance, or thanks, or inquiry, the lad shot from the
room.</p>

<p>Ike prepared some coffee, he had all necessary appliances,
and he had plenty of bread and cold meat, and he returned
as quickly as possible with the food; he placed it on the
table, and demanded:</p>

<p>“Where are your plates, and knives and forks?”</p>

<p>“We have none, all are gone.”</p>

<p>Ike had noticed, as stated, that there were few things in
the room; the woman reposed on a cot, there was a table
and one chair, no carpet, and he, at the last moment, discovered
that there was no stove nor any of the usual, even
poor equipments that can be found in the poorest apartments.</p>

<p>Again he left the room and soon returned with cups,
plates, knives and forks, and he bustled around and set
things all ready for eating. He carried the invalid a cup
of coffee, and some bread and meat, which she devoured
with avidity. The little girl also betrayed an excellent
appetite and as her hunger became appeased she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Mamma, this is just splendid.”</p>

<p>Ike’s curiosity was aroused and he asked:</p>

<p>“Madam, how is it I find you so poor?”</p>

<p>“I am a widow, and managed to get along well enough
until I was taken sick; my husband was mate of a vessel;
the vessel was wrecked and all lives were lost.”</p>

<p>“How long ago did it all happen?”</p>

<p>“My husband was wrecked five years ago.”</p>

<p>“And have you no friends?”</p>

<p>“No, I was an orphan and my husband was born in the
West Indies. He never spoke of having any relatives.”</p>

<p>The woman had appeased her appetite, and she said:</p>

<p>“Now tell me about yourself.”</p>

<p>“Mine is a strange tale, madam. I have a faint, a very
faint recollection of once being in a great big house, and<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
as the opera goes, ‘with vassals and serfs at my side.’ It
may all be a dream, recollections of splendors that belonged
to some one else. Later I remember enduring great hardship
with a strange old man; we were in France, England,
Spain and Italy, and finally embarked for America; by
that time I was old enough to remember all that occurred.
We arrived in the United States and the old man commenced
instructing me in all kinds of magical skill. He
was a magician, we traveled all over the country, and I
learned a great deal. He was a strange man, always making
strange and mysterious allusions; but he never would
make any actual explanations, nor would he tell me anything
about myself. He accumulated a great deal of
money, and&mdash;” the lad proceeded and related the subsequent
facts which are known to our readers.</p>

<p>“And he deserted you!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And took all the money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you offered me the only five dollars which you
had in the world?”</p>

<p>“What odds? I can make lots of money, and I am alone.
I’ve got an idea and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ike was interrupted; there came a rap at the door, the
woman betrayed agitation and the little girl turned deathly
pale and instinctively ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! it is that awful man.”</p>

<p>Ike suspected the identity of the awful man and called
out:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>A mean-looking man entered the room.</p>

<p>“I have come for my money,” he said.</p>

<p>“How much money is due you?” asked Ike.</p>

<p>“Four dollars and seventy-five cents&mdash;one month’s
rent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Here is your money, give me the change and a receipt
as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>It did not take the man long to hand over the change
and the receipt&mdash;the latter he had ready&mdash;and then in a
cold-blooded manner, he announced:</p>

<p>“You must move out, I have let the rooms, the new
tenants will come in this afternoon.”</p>

<p>The poor woman struggled hard to say something; she
was about to make an appeal but Ike anticipated her and
declared:</p>

<p>“That’s all right, we will be out of here in an hour.”</p>

<p>The man went away and did not hear the woman’s call
for him to return. At length she said to Ike:</p>

<p>“What have you done?”</p>

<p>“The right thing, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what will become of us?” moaned the woman</p>

<p>“You are all right for three months.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I told you that the rooms overhead were paid for three
months in advance; they belong to me, you will move up.”</p>

<p>“And turn you out?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I will take you in.”</p>

<p>“We cannot live on you.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“That is what I thought, so I just did the ‘think’ for
you, and for the present you are all right.”</p>

<p>We will not relate all the arguments Ike used to induce
the poor widow with her child to move into his rooms.
He succeeded, however, and he set right to work to move
her few things upstairs; she and her daughter were to
occupy one room, and Ike determined to take possession of
the bed formerly used by his late master, and he did so
with the remark.</p>

<p>“I am the boss now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>That same evening the woman whom he had befriended
and whose name was Pell, said:</p>

<p>“As soon as I am well I will repay you for all you have
done for us.”</p>

<p>“All right, we will wait until you are well.”</p>

<p>A few days passed. Ike had not fully determined on
what he would do, as his provisions were fast being
devoured. He had no money to pay his rent on the rooms,
and in a most startling manner he learned that he must
pay for the rooms or&mdash;well, he adopted the or&mdash;for he was
fully assured that the contemptible landlord had determined
to take a mean advantage. In some way the fellow
learned or suspected that the man who had paid him for
the rooms had gone away. He possibly suspected that the
rooms had been paid for in advance to the advantage of
the boy, and the widow and her child. At any rate one
night he called and demanded the month’s rent.</p>

<p>“No rent is due you,” said Ike; “you have been paid
three months in advance from the first of last month.”</p>

<p>“I have, eh?”</p>

<p>“You have!”</p>

<p>“Then produce the receipt; that is the shortest way to
settle it.”</p>

<p>Old Andro had forgotten, or in some way failed to give
Ike a receipt for the rooms. Ike took in the situation at
once; he was a wonderfully quick lad, and he said:</p>

<p>“You call here to-morrow night and you shall have the
receipt.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will call here to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>As stated, Ike took in the whole situation. The man was
a “skin” and intended to steal three months’ rent, and our
hero determined to beat him at his game.</p>

<p>We have indicated all along that Nimble Ike was a very
resolute and smart fellow, possessed of nerve, experience,
and cuteness. He had no notion of letting the mean landlord
succeed in his trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>After the man’s departure Mrs. Pell said:</p>

<p>“It is as I feared, we will turn you out of your apartments.”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“You heard the man’s threat?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“He is a terrible man.”</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has several times nearly frightened me to death.
He appears very mild until he is aroused and then he is
an awful, violent man.”</p>

<p>“He has scared you several times?”</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will give him the scare of his life when he
comes here to-morrow night. I will produce <em>a living
receipt</em> for him. He will think the devil is after him.
Mebbe I will scare a year’s rent out of him. I think I
can.”</p>

<p>Ike had received tickets for a show that evening and he
asked Mrs. Pell to let her daughter Lulu go with him.</p>

<p>“My child has never been to the theater in her life.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. She will enjoy it the more; let
her go, I pray you, by all means.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell finally consented.</p>

<p>Lulu was delighted at the idea of going, and at an early
hour the two proceeded to the theater. It was a variety
performance and among the several entertainments a
magician was to appear, a man who had been advertised
in the play-bills as the most wonderful magician the world
had ever seen; a man who could put the Indian jugglers to
shame. Ike had seen these advertisements and he looked
forward to heaps of fun; in case he called for a volunteer
from the audience our hero intended to volunteer and permit
the juggler to make him appear ridiculous and foolish&mdash;“oh,
yes, mebbe so!”&mdash;was the lad’s mental ejaculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>The show proceeded and there were many very pleasant
and charming acts and finally the necromancer appeared on
the stage. He was a “dude from dudedom” and as Ike perceived
at a glance a regular “fake,” a man who was merely
an imitator and practically a fraud.</p>

<p>The fellow performed some tricks with cards and one or
two simple little sleight of hand acts, when he called for a
volunteer and our hero leaped upon the stage. As usual
the “fake” commenced making witty remarks and the
audience laughed. Finally the performer said:</p>

<p>“My son, did you know that some little boys were regular
silver mines? Now I am going to prospect on you; mebbe
I can find quarter-dollars in your nose, ears and eyes?”</p>

<p>The manipulator handed our hero a plate to hold and on
the plate he placed a dozen quarters. He did it with such
a great display, letting them fall one at a time, counting
them as they fell; and then he took the plate and jingled
them, all the time making very funny remarks&mdash;not funny
but intended to be so; then he turned his back a minute
and returned to do his act, when he started back in amazement:
the silver on the plate had all disappeared.
Ike had stood perfectly still, not once moving from
the spot where the juggler had placed him. He looked
innocent and simple enough, while the magician gazed in
amazement. The audience meantime were leaning forward
in great expectancy, to behold the wonderful trick.
The magician was, as may be supposed, completely nonplussed,
but he was a bright, tricky fellow. He stepped
to the front and requested two gentlemen to step upon the
stage. After the usual delay two good-looking men did
step upon the stage, and the magician said:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, a most extraordinary incident
has occurred. You all saw me place twelve quarter dollars
on that plate; they have disappeared; that lad could not
resist the temptation and has stolen them, and I have<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
requested the gentlemen to come forward and search this
boy. I confess this is no trick on my part.”</p>

<p>The audience and the gentlemen all supposed that the
whole was a part of the performance, and they proceeded
to search Ike. They did so thoroughly, the magician
standing by and watching them. The men did not find
the money and matters were at a standstill for a few
moments. The magician was greatly disturbed. He
stood like one dazed, and as there had been no result the
audience began to get wearied, and there came a cry of
“Go on with the show.”</p>

<p>The magician stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I protest that the quarters have
been stolen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. Go on with the show.”</p>

<p>The real fact was the performer did not have any more
quarters&mdash;he hadn’t received his salary. He was a gambler
and the three dollars in silver was all the money he possessed.
He had been compelled to save them for his great
act.</p>

<p>The man stepped up to Ike and said:</p>

<p>“You scoundrel, if you don’t surrender that money, I’ll
call an officer and have you arrested.”</p>

<p>Ike turned, and facing the audience, said:</p>

<p>“This man accuses me of stealing his money. He can’t
work his trick, and that’s the way he is trying to get out
of it.”</p>

<p>When the magician had threatened our hero he had
stepped quite close to him and had whispered in his ear.
We relate this in order that our readers will more readily
comprehend what is to follow.</p>

<p>“You stole my money,” said the magician.</p>

<p>“You had the two gentlemen search me.”</p>

<p>“You have the money.”</p>

<p>The magician was losing his head and Ike said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, if I have fair play I can prove
that man is a ‘fake,’ and that he is trying to sneak out
of a trick he promised to perform. He said he would
make a silver mine of me, and now he is trying to prove I
am only a <em>quicksilver</em> mine, and got away quickly with
his money. I ask fair play.”</p>

<p>The audience was interested and excited, and Ike continued:</p>

<p>“Those gentlemen searched me; let them search that
fellow and if my words aren’t proven true, he can kick me
off the stage.”</p>

<p>The magician, not dreaming of possibilities, threw his
arms aloft and challenged:</p>

<p>“All right, gentlemen, search me.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen went into the “fake’s” pockets and to
the amazement of every one present drew forth the money.
There was no acting in surprise and even alarm displayed
by the “fake.” He stood like one stricken with paralysis.
He was dumb.</p>

<p>“Now, then, gentlemen, did I steal his money? Isn’t he
a ‘fake,’ and didn’t he try to crawl out of his trick by
accusing me?”</p>

<p>There is no consideration on a variety stage. The side-show
had consumed all the allotted time of the “fake,”
the succeeding performers were ready to go on, they were
in the wings and calling upon the “fake” to come off.</p>

<p>The man was dizzy with surprise, and Ike said:</p>

<p>“You let him go on with his trick. He can’t come the
trick of making three dollars out of me, or work upon the
sympathies of this audience to make good his three dollars.”</p>

<p>The proprietor had been a witness of the affair. He had
been standing in the front. He went round to the stage
and appeared just in time to call the man off. The latter
made a bow to the audience, and amidst a shower of hisses
left the stage, and our hero regained his seat in the
audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>Lulu, who had been greatly excited, inquired:</p>

<p>“Did he really accuse you falsely, Ike?”</p>

<p>“You saw what occurred,” was all that our hero
answered. He was satisfied; the man whom he had made a
show of once kicked him without cause. Our hero recollected
the kick and thus repaid it.</p>

<p>When the show was over Ike and Lulu returned home.
On the following day Ike was busy. He was preparing the
living receipt for the landlord when he called. At the
appointed hour the man appeared and to his surprise at a
table there sat the old magician, Andro.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want,” in a gruff tone demanded
the old necromancer.</p>

<p>The landlord stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told,” said the old man at the table, “that
you claim I did not pay three months’ rent in advance.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten it, and I came to-night to tell you I
had made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you called to explain your mistake?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit I paid you three months’ rent in
advance?”</p>

<p>“Ah, certainly; ah, certainly; I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>At this moment there came an inquiry from the hall.</p>

<p>“Will you want me, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, officer, you can go, I was about to have this man
arrested.”</p>

<p>The landlord stared; he had not seen an officer when he
entered the room, and he commenced to make all manner
of apologies, and old Andro said:</p>

<p>“I am going away for a few weeks, and I trust this
mistake won’t occur again.”</p>

<p>The landlord departed, still apologizing until the last
moment, and after he had gone the pretended Andro
leaped from his seat, slid off a disguise, and Ike, the tricky<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
and wonderful Ike, ran down the stairs calling after the
landlord, and when the latter answered, the boy said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Andro says you did not stop to examine the
receipt.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s all right; I know he has the receipt. I do
not wish to see it; it was all a mistake.”</p>

<p>Ike returned to the room and Mrs. Pell and Lulu came
from the inner room, and the lady said:</p>

<p>“Ike, you are a wonderful fellow.”</p>

<p>Even in less than two days, with good food and care,
Mrs. Pell had commenced to show considerable improvement,
so that she was able to leave her bed, and move from
room to room.</p>

<p>She and Ike sat down for a long talk. Ike had told his
history and he proposed that as he had lost his father, as
he called old Andro, Mrs. Pell would have to be a mother
to him, and he added:</p>

<p>“I must hie me around and get into making money.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you start out as a magician and ventriloquist?”</p>

<p>“For the best reason in the world,” answered Ike.
“There are so many ‘fakes’ in the business it has ceased
to be a drawing card, and there are hundreds of amateurs
in the business. I’ve got a scheme, however, and I will
carry it out. I have an idea I can make money and possibly
a fortune in time. We will see, but I need friends, I
need some one to confide in, to counsel with me, and to be
company for me, and I want you to become my mother.”</p>

<p>“I do not feel that it is right for me to permit you to
support myself and my child, and as soon as my health is
fully restored I shall recommence to earn my own living.”</p>

<p>“We will talk about that when your health is restored.
In the meantime, you are to act as counselor and friend to
me.”</p>

<p>A few days passed and Ike was casting around for an<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
opening, not on the boards, but in reality a chance to start
in and make a dollar, as he put it. He had a home but no
money, and there were three to feed; all his provisions
were gone and also all his money, and it was absolutely
necessary that he should get on to something that would
bring in a dollar or two, and in a most remarkable and really
dramatic manner the opportunity at last opened up to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>Ike was a curious little fellow. We mean, he possessed
the bump of curiosity to a great degree and he was constantly
poking around into all manner of odd places. It
had become a mania with him, and one evening he was
walking along the street when he beheld a gentlemanly
looking man walking in company with two of the
worst-looking characters to be seen anywhere. Our hero
had knocked around the world long enough to know that
strange and even tragic incidents were of constant occurrence.
In support of the above opinions we will state that
the writer was once asked where he got so many weird and
tragic incidents to record, and the answer was a reference
to a morning paper. In that paper there was a record of
two abductions, one secret murder, a poisoning case, eleven
assaults, seven cases of robbery, one case of illegal confinement
in an insane asylum, the account of a trial for will
forgery, four mysterious disappearances and several minor
accounts of odd and strange occurrences. We called our
friend’s attention to the several startling records and then
said:</p>

<p>“This is our guide book; we go to the detective bureau
for further information. There are more strange, startling
and romantic cases occurring than we can follow, or
possibly record.”</p>

<p>And this is true, if the municipalities of our great cities
were to keep a history, follow to the end and record the
denouement of one year’s thrilling experiences in a great
city like New York, more strange, marvelous stories would<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
go on record than can be found in a dozen so-called works
of fiction.</p>

<p>Ike had become quite a detective in one respect&mdash;in
knocking around the world. He had become very observant;
he was quick to notice anything unconventional or
odd, and as stated, when he saw a gentleman walking along
in company with men who looked like veritable rogues, he
made up his mind that “something was up” and that he
possibly had got on to a startling drama in real life. One who
has observation and time can easily do so. The lad started
to follow the men and saw them enter a hotel on a side
street; he followed in by the side door. The three men
went to the bar and had a drink, and then ascended to a room
on the top floor of the building. Ike was not dismayed;
when once starting in on a “lay” he followed by taking all
the chances. He saw the men enter a room, and he
entered the adjoining one, which happened to be vacant,
and he muttered:</p>

<p>“If I am caught, I am in for it, but there is something
going on, and I want to know what it is.”</p>

<p>Fortune favored the lad. The rooms were a sort of
attic apartments, and extended out on a projection. He
crawled out and stationed himself by the window of the
room in which the three men had assembled. He lay
down, face forward, and was prepared to listen, having discovered
that he could plainly overhear every word spoken
above a whisper, and all his suspicions were verified in the
most remarkable manner. The men had just finished a
drink from a bottle of whiskey which they had brought upstairs
with them, when one of them said:</p>

<p>“Now, sir, we are ready to listen to your proposition.”</p>

<p>The man said: “I have an enemy; I want to get him out
of the way.”</p>

<p>“You want him ‘dropped out?’”</p>

<p>“No, not that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I want him to disappear.”</p>

<p>“For how long a time?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, I have a house out on Long Island. He
is a dangerous man. If I could have him abducted and
taken to that house I could take care of him for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you merely wish to abduct him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; in a mysterious manner, so that it will appear
that he is dead.”</p>

<p>“It is a dangerous job, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but dangerous jobs earn big pay.”</p>

<p>“That is all we are looking for, but it is a state’s prison
offense if there is a mis-go. We take all the chances.”</p>

<p>“There need be no mis-go; we can arrange our plans
so well.”</p>

<p>At that moment a startling incident occurred. Ike
heard a noise behind him. He rose suddenly and unthinkingly,
and the next instant he was caught in a strong pair
of arms and dragged into the room through which he had
crawled out upon the projection. He was in the hands of
a powerful man, who exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah! you little thief, I’ve caught you at last, and the
mystery is explained.”</p>

<p>Ike made no outcry. He did not wish the men in the
adjoining room to get on to the fact that he had overheard
a part of their plans.</p>

<p>“What were you doing out there?” asked the man, who
had seized, and who held Ike.</p>

<p>“I was out after that cat.”</p>

<p>“What cat?”</p>

<p>“Out on the roof.”</p>

<p>“You miserable little sneak thief, there is not a cat in
the house, and surely there couldn’t be one on the roof.”</p>

<p>At that moment the mew of a cat was distinctly heard
right by the window, and the next instant the spitting,
snarling meows of two cats was heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>The man gazed in amazement.</p>

<p>“I was up doing you a service,” said Ike, “how could
you have slept with those cats there all night?”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Up the street. One of them is my cat.”</p>

<p>Even while the man was speaking the spitting and
meowing of the cats was heard, and then there came a
crash. It was evident that some one in an adjoining room
had hurled a pitcher or washbowl, or some other piece of
china at the night prowlers.</p>

<p>“Hang it,” said the man, “you may be telling the truth.”</p>

<p>The next instant the bark of a dog was heard right by
the window, and then a series of screeches and snarls.</p>

<p>The man uttered an ejaculation of amazement and ran
to the window, releasing his hold on Ike, and our hero improved
his opportunity by darting from the room. The
man turned to say something and saw that the boy had
“skipped.”</p>

<p>“Well, hang it, he told the truth, and I must get rid of
those infernal cats, or not a wink of sleep will I have
to-night.”</p>

<p>The man crawled through the window and looked all
over, but the cats had disappeared.</p>

<p>He crawled back with the remark:</p>

<p>“I reckon they have been scared off, but it is very singular,
I never heard any cats around here before. Some one
must have chased them on to that roof.”</p>

<p>Meantime Ike had made his way downstairs, and when
he gained the street he laughed heartily and said:</p>

<p>“There’s tricks in all trades but ours; by joky poky,
won’t that always be a mystery to that old fellow in that
room? He doesn’t know that I carry a whole menagerie
in my throat.”</p>

<p>Ike was a wonderful ventriloquist, equal to any one who
ever attempted vocal deceptions, and far better than a<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
majority of public performers, and when it came to imitating
animals and locating their growls, barks and hisses at a
distance, he could in that direction beat any one in the
world.</p>

<p>He did not walk off. He had gotten on to something
immense, as he expressed the initial steps in a great crime,
and he regretted that he did not have an opportunity to
overhear all the details, and the outcome of the man’s proposition
to the two abductors.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard enough,” he muttered. “I’ll bet a big
apple I can locate the house on Long Island, so if any one
is missing I will be able to trail down to his prison, and
what is more, I’ve seen all the three men. I can identify
every one of them, and I am not through with them yet.”</p>

<p>The lad hung around the hotel until after midnight,
when he saw the man who had made the proposition come
forth. He followed him and located him at one of the
most fashionable hotels in New York. He actually followed
him into the hotel and located the man in his room.
He had great luck in escaping observation, for he was such
a nimble little “cuss” he was sure to succeed where many
would have failed.</p>

<p>He succeeded, as stated, in following the man to his
room, but when it came to making his way again to the
street, he failed. He was stealing along when suddenly he
felt himself in a strong grasp. Ike was like an eel, as nimble
as a fish, but he thought it better to resort to stratagem to
escape rather than try to wrench himself away.</p>

<p>It was the night watchman who had seized him, and
who asked:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I got in here by a mistake. I am a stranger and I got
in the wrong hotel.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do; you are a thief and I shall take you
down to the office, and have you taken in. I’ve been on
the lookout for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“I can prove my innocence,” said Ike.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can, eh?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“You will have a chance, little sly thief. Yes, you
shall have a chance, but I’ve been on the ‘lay’ for you all
the same.”</p>

<p>Ike allowed himself to be led along. He knew what he
was up to, and he went along as quietly as Mary’s
little lamb. As intimated, Nimble Ike was what the
boys call awfully smart, and he had nerve of the very
first quality. He just acted as meek as a little girl
until they reached the great staircase, and were descending
the last flight of steps leading to the office, when
suddenly a dog snapped at the calves of the night
watchman’s legs. The man was entirely off his guard.
He felt as safe as a ship floating on a smooth lake
in midsummer, and the bark and snap came so suddenly
he released his hold on Ike, leaped into the air, and as he
came down struck on the carpeted edge of the step, fell
over and rolled to the bottom. Ike was more nimble, however;
the moment the man released him, he made a plunge
down the stairs, went down the broad rails “belly gutters,”
as the boys say, and away he went across the marble
office floor, and out into the darkness and away. Meantime
the watchman had rolled over and over, and slid out
on the marble floor, and one of the bell boys ran to his
assistance.</p>

<p>“Where in thunder,” demanded the watchman, as he
rose to his feet, “did that darn dog come from?”</p>

<p>“There weren’t no dog, Boss.”</p>

<p>“There weren’t no dog?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“How dare you contradict me; didn’t he spring at me
from behind?”</p>

<p>“There weren’t no dog. I was looking at you when you
came down the stairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“What do you want to lie for?”</p>

<p>“I was looking straight at you.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t hear that dog?”</p>

<p>“I heard him, but I didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“You heard him and didn’t see him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why, he sprang right at my heels when I was half-way
down the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard him, but there weren’t no dog there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me a liar.”</p>

<p>“I know what it was.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what was it?”</p>

<p>“You were tricked.”</p>

<p>“Tricked?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“That boy.”</p>

<p>“That boy?” repeated the man.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How could he trick me?”</p>

<p>“He was a ventrickulist, I guess, for there weren’t no
dog there in sight, and yet I heard him.”</p>

<p>“Impossible.”</p>

<p>“No, those fellows can do wonderful tricks. You had
him under arrest?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he fooled you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you ten dollars I saw a dog.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir, stick to it,” said the bell boy, and he
walked away. The night watchman was mad. He had
lost his prisoner and it did run through his mind that
possibly he had been tricked, and then he had rolled down
the stairs in front of all the other bell boys and the night
clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“Did you know that boy?” he asked, walking over to
the bell-boys’ bench.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve seen fellows like him at the show. You
were fooled, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet there was a dog. It isn’t possible for a human
being to perform an imitation like that.”</p>

<p>At this moment a second time a dog barked at the
man’s heels, and yelling “There, there!” he leaped away
and turned with drawn club to strike, but there was no dog
for him to club. He just gazed in amazement and
muttered:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged.”</p>

<p>The man meditated a moment and then went toward the
door. As he did so he beheld a nimble little form dart from
behind a column and dash away. He started in pursuit,
but the trickster was too nimble for him and got away.</p>

<p>The watchman went out to the street and peered around
for some time, but saw no more of the dog-maker as he
called him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Ike returned to his home, and it was
after one o’clock when he arrived. Mrs. Pell was waiting
for him. She had been worried, and Ike said:</p>

<p>“You must never be worried about me. I may sometimes
be gone two or three days at a time. Here’s a quarter
to get a meal to-morrow, and I am happy to say that I
think I am in the way to make quite a big stake. I can’t
tell, but it looks that way now.”</p>

<p>On the morning following the incidents we have recorded,
Ike was out bright and early, and he went over to the hotel
to which he had traced the man the preceding night.</p>

<p>It was late when he saw the man come forth, and he at
once fell to his trail, and followed the man down town.
He saw him enter an office over which was a sign, Fellman
&amp; Co., Bankers.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that is Fellman or the Co.?” muttered Ike<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
as he walked past the office, and took a close survey as far
as he could from the outside.</p>

<p>He was still gazing when he saw a fine-looking young
man, evidently not more than five or six-and-twenty, enter
the building, and a moment later he saw him enter the
office into which the man he had been trailing had proceeded.
Our hero could see into the office from the street.
He saw the young man greet the elder one and he remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, that young fellow has a fine face. He is not a
rogue, but I cannot say as much about the older man. If
I didn’t know he was up to an underhand scheme, I should
set him down as a mean sneak. He carries a map of mean
town on his face. I reckon I’ll find out which is which,
and who’s who, and then I can lay out my course.”</p>

<p>A little later and a lad whom Ike had seen flitting around
the office came forth. Our hero followed him and when a
chance offered went up and addressed him, saying:</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom.”</p>

<p>“You’re off,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you in Fellman &amp; Co’s. office?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“I thought so; don’t you remember me?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny, but let me see, mebbe I’ve made a mistake;
what is the name of the young man who is the junior
partner in your place?”</p>

<p>“His name’s Burlein.”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me, I’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Ike walked away and the lad stood and looked after him
while our hero remarked:</p>

<p>“I’ve made a little progress, I’ve found out the name of
the man who is putting up the job.”</p>

<p>Ike knew it was necessary to pick up a little money, and<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
he didn’t know just how to do it. He had walked back to
the vicinity of Fellman &amp; Co’s. office when he saw the
younger partner, Burlein, come forth. He stood looking
at the young man, when the latter, singularly enough,
advanced directly toward him.</p>

<p>“Are you busy?” demanded Burlein, addressing our
hero.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you carry a note for me?”</p>

<p>“I can, sir.”</p>

<p>“Our office boy cannot be spared and I wish to send a
note up town. Can you carry it?”</p>

<p>“I can, sir.”</p>

<p>The young man handed our hero an addressed note and
told him to deliver it, and wait for an answer. At the same
time he gave Ike a quarter to pay his car-fare.</p>

<p>Ike wasn’t spending any money for car-fares, and away
he went like a young deer. He reached the house, a nice
three-story brown-stone house, located in a side street
leading off from Fifth avenue. He rang the bell, and to
the colored boy who answered the ring he handed the note
and said he was to wait for an answer. He was kept waiting
on the stoop for fully fifteen minutes, when the colored
boy brought him a note, and handed him twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>“Well,” muttered Ike as he walked away, “this is a great
day’s business.”</p>

<p>He observed that the note was addressed in a lady’s fine
hand, and in good season he appeared at the office and
delivered the missive to young Mr. Burlein, who handed
him a half dollar. As Ike passed over the note and
received his pay, he observed that Fellman, the senior
partner, was glancing out from under his shaggy eyebrows.
A moment after Ike had left the office and was walking
along in an exuberant feeling at the idea of having made one
whole dollar, when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
started, and on the instant it shot through his mind that
he had been recognized by one or the other of the two men
whom he had run across upon the preceding evening, but
instead he recognized Fellman.</p>

<p>“Come with me, lad,” said the man.</p>

<p>Ike asked no questions. He was a lightning thinker,
and in a few brief seconds quite a volume of conjectures
had run through his mind.</p>

<p>The man led our hero down a narrow side street, and
then coming to a halt, inquired abruptly:</p>

<p>“Did you deliver a letter this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“A young man in an office over there.”</p>

<p>“But did you carry a letter for him?”</p>

<p>“Did I?”</p>

<p>“That is what I asked you.”</p>

<p>“What business is it of yours what I did?”</p>

<p>“Hold on, lad, don’t get mad so soon.”</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business, sir, what I did.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it my business.”</p>

<p>“You let go of me.”</p>

<p>Fellman had seized Ike by the arm.</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I know you won’t, I don’t mean to let you hurt me.”</p>

<p>The man discerned that Ike was one of those bright
boys, and many are to be met with the world over.</p>

<p>“You let go of me,” repeated Ike.</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt you, I say.”</p>

<p>“No, and I say I won’t let you.”</p>

<p>“Did you deliver a note?”</p>

<p>“It is none of your business.”</p>

<p>The man handed Ike a quarter; the lad refused to take
it, and saw his advantage at once.</p>

<p>“I don’t want your quarter,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it a half dollar.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I want you to answer my question.”</p>

<p>“I am not bound to tell you.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll pay you.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so anxious to find out what I did?”</p>

<p>“I have good reasons for wishing to know.”</p>

<p>“That don’t pay me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a dollar.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To tell me if you carried a letter and where you took it.”</p>

<p>“You want to know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, and I’ll pay you one dollar.”</p>

<p>“Only one dollar, eh! you must be rich.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want to answer me?”</p>

<p>“What will you pay?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, raise.”</p>

<p>“You are a little ‘beat.’”</p>

<p>“I am?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right, go off and I won’t beat you.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want to answer my question?”</p>

<p>Ike considered everything. He finally made up his mind
to tell if he received his price, and then he proposed to lay
around and notify the young man, Burlein, so there would
be no advantage on the part of Fellman. “I want a five-dollar
bill, that’s what I want.”</p>

<p>The man handed the lad a five-dollar bill, and our hero
was jubilant; here he was six dollars in hand, a big sum,
enough to take care of his family for a couple of weeks on
a pinch.</p>

<p>“Where did you take the letter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>“Uptown.”</p>

<p>“Where, uptown?”</p>

<p>Ike named the street.</p>

<p>“The number?” demanded the man.</p>

<p>Ike told the number.</p>

<p>“What was in the note?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? I don’t open letters, when I have
them to deliver.”</p>

<p>“You brought back an answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are a smart boy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Who wrote the letter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Was it a lady or a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“I should say it was a lady.”</p>

<p>“You judge from the handwriting?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That will do. You were well paid.”</p>

<p>Ike stood and looked after the man and muttered:</p>

<p>“Well, I am getting into this matter pretty deep; that
man has an enemy; he wants him put out of the way,
‘dropped out.’ Yes, I see, and now I know there is a
woman in the case, and I have already picked up six dollars
out of the adventure. A gold mine for me; good
enough, I am on the side of the young man, Burlein, and
I am against the old fellow. I begin to get on to things.
I’ll know more later, and a big game is being played, and
I am peeping into the mystery.”</p>

<p>Ike hung around the whole forenoon until he saw the
young man, Burlein, come forth, and then he followed
him. Our hero was fairly well dressed for a lad, and when
he saw Burlein enter a restaurant he followed, and boldly
took a seat at the same table. The young man stared, and
then said, good-naturedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“Well, lad, are you going to spend your half dollar?”</p>

<p>“Don’t cost as much as that for a meal in here, does it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon the cheapest meal you can get here is half a
dollar.”</p>

<p>The young man spoke good-naturedly, but as our readers
will hear, he was of a very pleasant temperament, and yet
withal, he was somewhat annoyed, as he suspected the boy
was set to work him, for he had read Ike, and perceived
that he was a very smart fellow.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can stand the meal to-day,” said Ike, and
he added:</p>

<p>“Mebbe you will treat me.”</p>

<p>Burlein did not like what he considered Ike’s boldness,
in fact he began to suspect that the lad was even smarter
than he had supposed, and there were reasons why he was
a little sensitive in one direction.</p>

<p>“If you expect me to pay for your meal, you are likely
to prove a victim to great expectations.”</p>

<p>There came a peculiar look to Ike’s face as he said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, you will change your ideas about me
before you and I are through.”</p>

<p>Burlein gazed in amazement. This was not the language
of a boy but of an experienced man of the world.</p>

<p>“Who are you, anyhow?” asked Burlein.</p>

<p>“I am Ike.”</p>

<p>“What is your last name?”</p>

<p>“We will get to that later on. Your name is Burlein.”</p>

<p>The young man started, for the address on the letter
had been simply “Ed;” the name Burlein had not
appeared on it.</p>

<p>“What do you do for a living?” demanded the young
man.</p>

<p>“We will come to that by and by. In the meantime, I
want to ask you a few questions.”</p>

<p>Burlein stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>“You are a strange lad,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am odd, but I know what I am about.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me you had a purpose in coming and seating
yourself here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had a purpose. I thought you might pay for
my dinner.”</p>

<p>“That was not your purpose.”</p>

<p>“You have fallen to that first, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>

<p>“All right, I want to ask you several questions, and I
want you to answer me fair and square.”</p>

<p>The surprise of young Burlein was increasing at every
word.</p>

<p>“You wish to ask me some questions?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“Is Fellman your partner?”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been associated together?”</p>

<p>There was a singular directness in Ike’s questions which
hardly accorded with his position as a mere lad.</p>

<p>“How does it concern you?”</p>

<p>“Is he your friend or your enemy?”</p>

<p>“That is a strange question, even impertinent, I should
say.”</p>

<p>“Answer me.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, boy; you are saucy, I will not
answer your question.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I give you a reason why you should answer
me.”</p>

<p>“Can you?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>“He is inquiring into your affairs.”</p>

<p>The young man stared with a glare of blank amazement
in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>“He is inquiring into my business?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what you mean?”</p>

<p>“I am telling you that he is inquiring into your private
affairs. He may suspect that you are robbing him.”</p>

<p>The young man, Burlein, was taken all aback. It was
the most extraordinary incident of his life. Here was a
mere lad sitting down and coolly holding out the most
startling suggestions.</p>

<p>“You are a remarkable lad,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am very observing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are, and your words imply something.”</p>

<p>“On my honor, they do.”</p>

<p>“Then talk right out.”</p>

<p>“I have talked out pretty plain. I tell you, your partner
is inquiring into your private affairs. I believe he is a
sneak. I believe you are a fair and square young man, so
I’m telling you the fact.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me how you know he is inquiring into
my affairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will tell. This morning you sent me with a
note?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“I brought you an answer?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“When I delivered that answer, I noticed your partner,
Mr. Fellman.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He was watching me very closely.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed in a relieved way, and asked:</p>

<p>“Is that all, my lad? My partner is a very nervous man.
He is always on the alert. He is always watching everything
that goes on around. Here, finish your dinner and
I will pay for it. You are, I am afraid, a little too smart,
but no doubt you mean well. I certainly am a very good-natured<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
man to have permitted you to say all I have listened
to.”</p>

<p>“But I am not through yet.”</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, I do not wish to hear any more.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>Ike pulled a five-dollar bill from his pocket and holding
it toward young Burlein said:</p>

<p>“You see that bill?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Your partner, Mr. Fellman, gave me that bill.”</p>

<p>Burlein suddenly turned deathly pale.</p>

<p>“My partner gave you that bill?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“For what service?”</p>

<p>“If I were on the make I could demand another five
from you for telling you.”</p>

<p>“And I might refuse you it, might look upon it as a
game to ‘do’ me out of five dollars.”</p>

<p>“It would be bad for you in the end, possibly. You
know the old adage, ‘Forewarned, forearmed.’”</p>

<p>“This is all very puzzling to me, lad.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it is, but your partner gave me that bill.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to give you another to tell me why
he gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not want you to pay me one cent.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me why he gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“I will. After I had delivered your answer to you, and
had left the office, what did Mr. Fellman do, can you
remember?”</p>

<p>The young man was thoughtful a moment, and appeared
to recall, and finally he brightened up and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember. He seized his hat and suddenly
ran out.”</p>

<p>“You remember that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell you why he ran out. He followed me,
caught me, led me to a side street, and asked me if I had
not just delivered you a letter. I told him ‘Yes,’ then he
asked, ‘Did you carry one?’ I answered, ‘Yes’; then he
asked, ‘Where did you take it.’ I refused to answer, and he
finally offered me five dollars to tell him. I did so,
resolved to come and tell you all that had occurred.”</p>

<p>The young man listened with starting eyes and deep
attention, and when Ike stopped, he sat for some moments
lost in deep thought, but finally he asked:</p>

<p>“Now, that leads you to think he is my enemy?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d at least tell you what had occurred.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed&mdash;his laugh, however, was a
forced one&mdash;as he said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, lad; yes, it’s all right, but you have interpreted
the little adventure the wrong way. Mr. Fellman
is my friend, and that is why he asked you those questions.
They were prompted by interest and anxiety on my
behalf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Burlein, all I have got to say is, look out for
his interest and anxiety in your behalf. You are not a
fool, neither am I. You are greatly disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;no, no; but see here; you have shown good
sense and judgment. The circumstances are a little peculiar.
Here is a ten-dollar bill for you. This has been a
good day, for I will pay for the dinner. Now, tell me
about yourself. Tell me who you are, what you are. Yes,
tell me the whole story.”</p>

<p>The young man spoke in a very nervous tone, and his
manner betrayed the fact that really he was very much
disturbed.</p>

<p>“There is not much to tell, sir. I am a lad who keeps<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
his eyes and ears open, that’s all, and I’ve put you on your
guard. You employed me to go upon an errand. I did
so and your partner betrayed a desire to find out all about
my errand. Yes, he cared five dollars’ worth, and it
struck me as very peculiar; and I thought I’d tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>“You were right, yes, just right. And now see here;
meet me to-morrow, be my guest. Say nothing to any one
and to-morrow we will talk this whole matter over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will meet you to-morrow and you may have
something to tell me and I may have something to tell you.
And I tell you one thing now; put not your trust in princes
or partners when they pay five dollars to find out who
sends you letters. That’s all; you may trust them, but
they do not trust you.”</p>

<p>Burlein paid for the dinner and separated from our hero.
When they issued forth Ike went home with his fifteen
dollars, and Burlein returned to his office to meditate, and
as the sequel will show he had ample subject for meditation.
But he was a brave, trusting and noble young man
and little dreamed of impending evil. He was surprised
and annoyed, that was all. Alas! when he awoke to his
real danger it was too late to avoid it.</p>

<p>Ike was quite proud when he handed Mrs. Pell ten dollars
and said:</p>

<p>“That is for the present. I am on a big ‘lay’ and may
make considerable money. I can’t tell, but I think I will.”</p>

<p>There came a thoughtful look in Mrs. Pell’s face. A
weird suspicion ran through her mind. Fifteen dollars
was a great deal of money for a mere youth in no regular
business to earn in one day. Ike, who was quick and
observant, saw the thoughtful look in his friend’s face
and he said:</p>

<p>“You need have no fear. I get all my money honestly.
I would neither hold nor receive money that did not come
to me honestly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>The lad lay around until night. He had a scheme in
his mind. He believed he had fathomed the whole scheme
of the man Fellman, and he also believed he had learned
the identity of the intended victim.</p>

<p>When night came the lad issued forth. He had spent a
part of the five dollars he had reserved for equipment, and
he believed he was prepared for almost any kind of villainy.
He proceeded direct to the hotel where the two men had
gone with Fellman to hold their consultation, and he lay
around until he saw one of the men approach and enter
the place.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” he muttered. “This is their headquarters.”</p>

<p>A little later and he saw the two men come from the
hotel together, and he started to follow them again,
muttering:</p>

<p>“I’ll be on hand to give an alarm, or follow them if I
cannot do any more.”</p>

<p>The two men strangely enough went direct to the vicinity
of the house to which our hero had carried the note, and
again he muttered:</p>

<p>“Is it possible I am mistaken? Is it the girl they mean
to abduct instead of the young man?”</p>

<p>The fellows lay around until nine o’clock, when our
hero saw young Burlein come along and enter the house,
and he also saw the two men go through a sort of pantomime.</p>

<p>“Aha!” muttered the lad, “now I recognize their ‘lay.’
They will wait until the young man starts for his home
about midnight, and then they will attempt their game,
whatever it may be.”</p>

<p>The two men walked away. Our hero followed them.
They entered a private house some distance away and Ike
lay around to watch. After a time he saw several men
enter the same house, and he put the question to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“Is it a gambling den, or a resort of thieves, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p>Ike was, like many boys, full of enterprise and courage.
He did not stop to think of danger&mdash;at his age probably
did not appreciate the possibilities of peril as an older person
would. He walked up and down several times before the
house and finally went around to the street toward which
the rear of the house faced and at once ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Eureka!”</p>

<p>He found an alleyway between two houses, one of
them directly in the rear of the house he was “piping,”
and watching his opportunity he scaled the iron gate
and grating and landed in the alleyway. “Now,” he said,
“I must go slow; it won’t do to be caught here.”</p>

<p>Noiselessly he stole along to the rear yard, intending to
climb the rear fence between the two buildings. He had
almost reached the line of fence when suddenly he heard a
savage growl and a powerful animal sprang upon him.
Certainly the lad received a shock, but as stated he had
equipped himself and he seized the dog ere the animal
could bite. The next instant with a moan of pain and
surprise the huge dog fell over helpless, and our hero
remarked:</p>

<p>“That’s the way I serve everyone, doggy, who comes
too close to me without a proper introduction.” Ike scaled
the fence and found himself in the yard in the rear of the
house he had seen the men enter, and he was on the lookout
for dog number two as he cautiously stole along toward
the porch of the house. He met no dog and the house
appeared to be dark save a stream of light which shot
through the blinds from the second-story room.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” said the lad. A moment he stood and
considered, and then he made an effort to climb one of the
columns of the porch, and he succeeded with the apparent
readiness and ease of a trained acrobat or sailor boy. When<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
he reached the roof of the porch he lay on his belly and
slowly crawled forward, and in good time arrived at a position
under one of the windows. Here he lay low for a few
seconds before rising to his feet. When he did attempt to
rise he did it very slowly until he had his eyes on a level
with the lower blind opening, and then he peeped in.
Several men were seated around a table; wine was before
them and they were all talking in a very earnest manner.</p>

<p>“It may be a gambling house and it may not be,” muttered
the lad, and he added: “I wish I could overhear
what those men are saying.”</p>

<p>Ike considered for a long time. Finally he determined
upon a bold and really desperate plan. The plucky boy
resolved to enter that house. He was bent upon hearing
the talk of those men. He crawled to the end window
opening into the small hall bedroom or bath-room. He was
equipped for business, as we have indicated, and it did not
take him long to undo the fastening, and pull the blind
open. Then he tried the window. It was fastened, but
the new-fangled catch was not in use and it did not take
him long to slide the hammer and raise the sash. Only a
moment he considered, and then boldly crawled in. He
knew his peril. He knew they were desperate men and
did they once suspect that he had overheard any of their
talk and catch him his chances would be very slim; and
yet he faced the peril.</p>

<p>There was no need for pretense and he removed his
shoes and slipped across the room. He found the door
unlocked and passed to the hall, and then along to the
door of the room in which he had seen the men. Peeping
through the keyhole he saw them still sitting there.
They were not laughing and talking like men enjoying
themselves, but were evidently holding a very earnest consultation.
Our hero was of keen hearing and could catch
almost every word that was spoken&mdash;at least sufficient to
know the sense of what was being said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>One man appeared to be in authority. He was asking a
great many questions, and Ike heard the question put:</p>

<p>“Are you certain that they carry as much money as that
in their safe?”</p>

<p>“According to my information they do.”</p>

<p>“Who is your informant?”</p>

<p>“The typewriter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you are soft on her, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I am playing the good Sunday-school teacher dodge
on her. I’ve met her a great many times at church, got
up a speaking acquaintance, and she thinks I am a model of
good deeds.”</p>

<p>“Say, old man, women are dangerous to deal with.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, generally, but I am all right here.”</p>

<p>“They are very close observers. Do you know a woman
can beat a man noting and giving descriptions?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>“This woman has talked to you and in case anything
should happen she will give a clew to the cops. They are
dangerous people to deal with&mdash;they are not afraid to talk
up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only worked on her for the information.”</p>

<p>“And they carry large sums over night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes sixty or seventy thousand.”</p>

<p>“Not as a rule?”</p>

<p>“No, but there are times.”</p>

<p>“If we knew one of those times.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I am getting on to. I will know one
of those times. We can have our plans all laid and ‘nip’
the ‘swag’ easy.”</p>

<p>“Well,” was the thought that ran through Ike’s mind.
“I am getting into a few complications by following those
two men last night. I’ve opened up a nest of crime.” He<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
lay low and heard considerable more talk; indeed, the full
details of a plan to rob a safe of a great banking house, and
he had about taken it all in when suddenly a heavy hand
was laid on his shoulder, and a gruff voice with an oath
demanded:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“It’s all up with me,” was the mental conclusion of our
hero, who declined to make a reply to the inquiry. Indeed
he had no time for replies. He needed his thoughts
to meet the emergency.</p>

<p>The man’s voice evidently aroused the fellows inside the
room, and the door was opened and Ike in his stocking feet
was forced into the room and confronted the conspirators.
The men stared with looks of amazement upon their
faces when the man who had captured Ike demanded:</p>

<p>“What have you fellows been discussing here?”</p>

<p>The evident leader of the gang took in the situation and
he was a quick-witted man. He answered:</p>

<p>“Oh, we have been discussing a new play we are going
to bring out. We think it a good scheme to make it
realistic and introduce a real burglar scene.”</p>

<p>The man who had asked the question laughed and said:</p>

<p>“You have had an audience during your rehearsal.”</p>

<p>He forced Ike into a chair and sitting opposite him as
the others gathered around he asked:</p>

<p>“Who are you, lad?”</p>

<p>Ike made no answer, but stared as though he were hard
of hearing&mdash;a poor trick, indeed, for the man said:</p>

<p>“Oh, that won’t do; don’t come the deaf and dumb
dodge on us. Mutes don’t stand in their stocking feet in
a dark hall with their ear to a keyhole.”</p>

<p>Ike laughed; he saw that his dodge didn’t work and he
came a more cunning one. He said:</p>

<p>“I am on to you men. You are not actors, you are
robbers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>The men all glared and exchanged glances.</p>

<p>The man who had captured Ike asked:</p>

<p>“Who sent you here?”</p>

<p>“No one sent me; I followed in here.”</p>

<p>“You followed in here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Who did you follow?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you mean, you little rascal? Are you
fooling? Be careful, we may hang you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will not hang me, but I was led in here.”</p>

<p>“You were?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>The man drew a pistol, aimed at the boy and said in a
menacing tone:</p>

<p>“Stop fooling.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t fooling.”</p>

<p>“Then talk out straight what you mean, or something
may be sent into you.”</p>

<p>“I was led in here.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, talk up. Who or what led you in here?”</p>

<p>“A cat.”</p>

<p>The men all laughed and Ike appeared as innocent as a
kitten when he made the statement.</p>

<p>“A cat led you in here, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I reckon, sonny, it was a cat chased you in here, for
you are <em>our mouse</em>, and you are trapped.”</p>

<p>Ike laughed as though the conceit was very funny, but
there came a change over his face when the man asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember what they do with mice when they
catch them?”</p>

<p>The lad did not answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>“They kill ’em&mdash;strangle ’em,” said the man.</p>

<p>The boy laughed. His assumption of carelessness and
innocence was immense.</p>

<p>“I reckon we will strangle you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t hurt me.”</p>

<p>“You are a smart lad. We’ve humored you, and now
answer my question, What were you doing there?”</p>

<p>“I was listening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that.”</p>

<p>“And that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And that’s all, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What were you listening to?”</p>

<p>“To these men.”</p>

<p>“And what did you hear?”</p>

<p>“I heard they were going to rob a house.”</p>

<p>“You heard that, eh?”</p>

<p>The boy answered so frankly the men really were for a
moment deceived, and one of them said:</p>

<p>“He is an idiot.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” queried the man who had captured Ike.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He is the smartest idiot you ever struck;” and addressing
Ike the man continued:</p>

<p>“So you chased a cat in here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How did the cat get in?”</p>

<p>Ike proved as keen-witted as the man who was questioning
him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“How did you know he was in here, my lad?”</p>

<p>“I saw him at the window.”</p>

<p>“And how did you get in?”</p>

<p>“I crawled in.”</p>

<p>“Crawled in where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I climbed up on the porch and got in through the
bath-room window.”</p>

<p>“You came after your cat?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“When I got in I heard men in this room, and I peeped
in and heard all they said.”</p>

<p>“You heard all?”</p>

<p>“I heard a good deal.”</p>

<p>“What did you hear?”</p>

<p>“I heard there was seven hundred thousand dollars in a
safe on a steamboat.”</p>

<p>“Oh you rascal!” exclaimed the man.</p>

<p>Ike did not wince, and the man finally said:</p>

<p>“We will hang you unless you prove your innocence.”</p>

<p>“How can I prove my innocence?”</p>

<p>“You say there was a cat here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did the cat get out?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He ran up the stairs.”</p>

<p>“You find that cat, or we will hang you.”</p>

<p>At that moment a cat was heard actually mewing in the
hall, and there Ike sat in the chair under the gaze of all
the men, and one of them said:</p>

<p>“By ginger, the lad tells the truth.”</p>

<p>Another of the men drew a club from his pocket and
started for the hallway. He saw no cat and in a moment
returned. In the meantime the men appeared to be confused
and the man who had captured our hero, said:</p>

<p>“We must take care of this lad. Here, Martin, you take
him upstairs, put him in the chain and secure him so he
cannot get away, and we will decide upon his fate. I vote
for hanging him unless he tells the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>Ike showed signs of great fear and one of the men
whispered:</p>

<p>“Hold on; you will scare him to death.”</p>

<p>The man answered:</p>

<p>“He must talk or he is a dead boy, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The man who had been ordered to take Ike upstairs and
bind him seized hold of the lad, and the latter began to
plead. The man who appeared to be the leader said:</p>

<p>“No use, sonny, there is only one way out of this&mdash;talk.”</p>

<p>“I am talking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are smart. You know what I mean&mdash;who sent
you here?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“All right, take him upstairs and we will decide what to
do with him.”</p>

<p>Ike was dragged from the room while protesting in the
most earnest manner, and so he struggled all the way up
the stairs.</p>

<p>After he had been led from the room, one of the men
said:</p>

<p>“You are wrong, cap.”</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“That lad did follow a cat in here, and he was so frank.”</p>

<p>“Was he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you heard all he said.”</p>

<p>“I did, and I’ve something to tell you. That is one of
the smartest lads in New York. He holds the liberty of
every man of us in his hands.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, cap?”</p>

<p>“I am astonished you fellows are not on to him.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He is a detective’s ‘cub,’ that’s what he is, and he
was sent here to ‘pipe’ us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“But we heard the cat, that part of his story was true.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“We heard the cat.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t see him, did you?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>While the conversation we have recorded was in progress
the man led our hero upstairs and Ike beheld a strong
room, a place where it was evident prisoners had been confined.
There was a regular steel chair in the room. The
boy took in the situation at a glance. Once in that steel
wire chair and he was a goner. Indeed, it was one of the
most ingenious contrivances he had ever beheld, and only
a lad of his wide experience would have discerned its use,
and with the rapidity with which thought can act he went
over all the possibilities.</p>

<p>He had ceased to offer resistance and the man said:</p>

<p>“Come, sonny, I am going to let you sit down in that
nice chair.”</p>

<p>“Are you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>The man seized the lad by the arms, but the next instant
he began to writhe and twist, and finally fell to the floor,
evidently paralyzed and helpless. Ike was a powerful fellow
for his age. He raised the man and placed him in the
chair, and his natural genius for invention discovered to
him at a glance how the chair was operated, and in less
time than we can tell the man was secured in the chair.
So skillful was the contrivance that a casque settled
upon his head, closed and held his jaws together better
than any gag ever invented, and there he sat powerless and
speechless.</p>

<p>Then Ike spoke. He had but an instant to stay and he
talked like a streak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>“<a id="Ref_55a" href="#Ref_55">Good day, my friend</a>, we will meet again. Send home
the cat when you find him.”</p>

<p>Ike did not descend to the floor from which he had been
led up, but ascended the scuttle well and passed out to
the roof. He thought he could take his chance better that
way rather than risk a second capture.</p>

<p>He had little difficulty in reaching the roof and closing
the covering after him. He started to navigate across the
house tops, looking for a convenient place for a descent to
the street.</p>

<p>In the meantime the men continued their talk. One of
them asked:</p>

<p>“Do you think the ‘cops’ are on our track?”</p>

<p>“I did not think so until I captured that detective
‘kid.’”</p>

<p>“You think he is a detective kid?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You’re off,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You feel sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is as innocent a lad as ever lived. If he had
been a detective kid do you suppose he would have admitted
all he overheard?”</p>

<p>“That is just where his smart work comes in. He has
evidently fooled you.”</p>

<p>“No, you have fooled yourself, old man. I’ll stake my
life he is no detective ‘kid.’”</p>

<p>The man who was stating the objections was the owner
of the house, the one who had been acting as chairman
during the “confab” to which our hero had been a listener.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you a hundred it turns out he is one of the best
in the business.”</p>

<p>“Will you be able to prove it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>“Then I will take the bet.”</p>

<p>“All right, wait until Barney comes down and learn what
he has to say.”</p>

<p>The men continued their talk for some time, but Barney
did not return, and finally the man who had been addressed
as captain said:</p>

<p>“One of you go upstairs and learn what the matter is.”</p>

<p>One of the men left the room and after a minute a yell
was heard.</p>

<p>All the men rushed to the hallway, and the captain ran
up the stairs followed by the man whom we have indicated
as being the master of the house, and who had made the
bet with the captain. The man at the head of the stairs
met the rushing party and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s been the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Come and see.”</p>

<p>The men entered the room and there sat their “pal” in
the chair, muzzled by the casque and tightly enfolded in the
wire contrivance. The captain ran forward, touched the
springs and when the man was released demanded:</p>

<p>“What in thunder has happened?”</p>

<p>All the man could ejaculate was:</p>

<p>“That boy!”</p>

<p>“What of him?”</p>

<p>“He is a fiend.”</p>

<p>“A fiend?” repeated the captain in a perplexed tone.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Explain.”</p>

<p>The man told his story. He said:</p>

<p>“I brought him up here. He was as quiet and meek as
Moses, and when I seized hold of him to put him in the
chair all power suddenly left me. I became as weak as a
sick cat. I fell helplessly to the floor. He then lifted me
up, placed me in the chair, worked the machinery and<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
there I was, speechless and helpless, and with a grin upon
his face&mdash;a demoniac grin&mdash;he walked off or vanished in
thin air, I do not know which.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool,” said the captain. “You have been
outwitted by a smart kid, a detective’s apprentice, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>The men descended to the lower room and held a long
“confab,” and the captain finally said:</p>

<p>“We are in luck.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“In discovering that lad. He heard the whole business.
We know now that the cops were on our track. Had the
‘kid’ got away we would have gone on with the job and
every man would have been captured. Yes, we are in
great luck.”</p>

<p>Our hero in the meantime managed to gain the street,
and he proceeded direct to the house into which Burlein
had gone. He lay around expecting the men to show up,
but they did not appear. But the young man did come
forth from the house and Ike fell to his trail. The lad
followed until he saw the young man seek to enter a house,
when our hero approached and called out:</p>

<p>“Don’t go in, I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Burlein.</p>

<p>“I am Ike.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the boy I saw to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I must talk to you.”</p>

<p>“All right, talk away.”</p>

<p>“You are in peril.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed and said:</p>

<p>“So you are not satisfied; you want to make another ten
out of me. You are a little fraud, I fear.”</p>

<p>“You think I am a fraud?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>“Well, yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then I’ve nothing to say. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Hold on; you have been dogging me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been laying around to protect you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been ‘laying around’ to protect me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come, tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“No, I am a fraud. I’ve nothing to say now, but some
day you will apologize and then I will tell you all.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now.”</p>

<p>“No; good-night.”</p>

<p>Without another word Ike skipped away. He went
direct to his home and to bed. He was tired and did not
attempt to think or plan that night, but on the following
morning he was out bright and early. He had quite a
good deal of business on hand.</p>

<p>Ike proceeded to the hotel where the two men lodged
whom he had twice dogged. He saw nothing of them until
late in the afternoon, then they came forth. He fell to their
trail and saw them meet Fellman, with whom they held a
long consultation. He tried to get near enough to overhear
what was said, but no opportunity offered. When the men
separated he fell to the banker’s trail and saw him go to
his hotel. The lad lay around. After having secured
a quick meal he lay around the hotel for a long time until
he saw Fellman come forth. It was about eight o’clock in
the evening. He followed the man and saw him enter a
house quite a distance up town. He hung around for a
couple of hours but the man did not reappear and Ike concluded
to postpone an investigation of the house to some
future time, and he proceeded down to the house where he
knew Burlein was a constant visitor, or at least so he had
concluded. In fact the lad had worked up a complete
theory as to the whole situation and was determined to be<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
on hand when anything occurred. He saw Burlein go to
the house and a little later the two men put in an appearance,
and he saw several other singular occurrences which
led him to conclude that the scoundrels had determined
to put their scheme, whatever it was, in execution that
very night, and he muttered:</p>

<p>“I reckon Burlein will not think I am a fraud when this
whole affair is over.”</p>

<p>The charge of being a fraud rankled in the young man’s
mind. He felt it unjust, and again he muttered:</p>

<p>“I will make him eat his words before morning, you
bet.”</p>

<p>Ike lay around until midnight and saw young Burlein
come from the house and walk up the street. The men
had disappeared and the boy did not know their exact position,
so he followed some distance behind, when suddenly
a most startling incident occurred. Burlein had reached
the corner. He appeared to be walking along in deep
thought. He had passed the corner and was stepping from
the curb to the crosswalk when suddenly two men leaped
forward and ran at him from behind. Ike ran forward
giving a shout, but his warning call came too late. The
young man had received a blow on the head which felled
him to the ground. Ike drew his pistol. He raised it to
fire at one of the two men, when suddenly everything swam
round in his head and as quickly everything became a
blank. How long Ike remained unconscious he never
knew exactly, but some time later he concluded that he
must have been out of his senses fully an hour. When
he returned to consciousness he was in a dark apartment.
He made an effort to move and could not, nor could he
discern an object a foot from his face. He lay still&mdash;it was
his only way. He determined to go slow, very slow, and
consider and if possible recall. He was, as the incident we
are about to relate will prove, an extraordinary fellow. He<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
first strove to line back his thoughts and if possible recall
all that had happened. He was certain something had
occurred&mdash;something very extraordinary. He picked up
his line of thought just where the extraordinary incident
must have occurred. He recalled how he had seen Burlein
knocked down. He recalled how he had attempted to
draw his pistol, and then all recollection ceased up to the
moment he found himself in the dark apartment, and
chained to the floor, as he discovered.</p>

<p>Ike was perfectly cool. His brightest and keenest wit
had returned to him, and he muttered:</p>

<p>“I see it all. Just as I was getting ready to shoot I
received a crack on the head. But where am I now?”</p>

<p>He felt around and discovered that he was chained by
his ankles&mdash;his hands were free.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” he muttered. “If I haven’t been
stripped I’ll find something.” He felt in his pocket and
found a match, and ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Here we are, sure enough.”</p>

<p>He managed to scratch the match and as it blazed up he
gazed round, and then an exclamation of consternation fell
from his lips as he cried out:</p>

<p>“I thought so. I am in the ‘brig’ of some sort of vessel
and I am out at sea. I have been kidnaped.” Then he
smiled as he repeated, “Yes, <em>kid</em>naped, for I am only a kid,
after all.”</p>

<p>Continuing his soliloquy the boy muttered:</p>

<p>“What do they mean to do with me? Do they mean to
drown me? Well, well, it’s hard luck, but it does look as
though I were ‘a goner’ for sure, and I will go down to the
bottom of the sea with the knowledge that I did not play
my cards well or I never would have been in this box.”</p>

<p>As intimated Ike formed a pretty correct idea as to all
that had happened, and he was indeed in a bad box; but
he did not despair. He possessed a wonderful talent, a<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
gift that had been carefully cultivated, and he had a great
field to work&mdash;the prevailing superstition of people generally,
and especially of sea-going men. Sailors are proverbially
superstitious and superstition prepares one to become
terrorized to a greater degree than any other sentiment.
Men who would kill a fellow man in cold blood tremble if
compelled to go through a cemetery at night. Men who
would lead a charge in a battle would fall to the ground paralyzed
with terror were their imagination to present to them
after dark a vivid apparition of a dead soldier. Ike was
well aware of these facts, and he determined to use his
knowledge in order, if possible, to save his life and effect
his escape. He knew he had fallen to the facts of a great
scheme and possibly a tragedy. The men who were actors
in the crime knew that he was a witness against them, and
the question arose, did they intend merely to get him out
of the way or did they intend to murder him or drown him
in cold blood?</p>

<p>He knew that it was after midnight when the incident
had occurred which led to his being a prisoner on
that boat. He was quite a sailor himself, and as he lit a
second match and glanced around, he concluded he was a
prisoner on a medium-sized schooner or sloop. How long
he had been there he had no means of knowing, as he had
been unconscious and had regained his consciousness in
total darkness. He concluded, however, that the possibilities
were it was not yet daylight. He learned that the
schooner was sailing over the waters, as he was down in
the hold. He knew from the motion that they were under
way and possibly far out to sea.</p>

<p>He lay and waited and fully an hour passed, when the
hatch over his prison was raised and he became aware that
a man was peering down upon him, and he knew it was
daylight. He had decided upon his course; it might cost
him a meal or two, but it was a part of his plan to lay low
and watch his chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>He heard a man on deck ask:</p>

<p>“Is he awake?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t moving, captain.”</p>

<p>“I hope he is dead and then all we will have to do is
throw his body over for the fishes.”</p>

<p>This dialogue was certainly a very consoling and comforting
one for a lad to listen to who was chained to the
upper side of the keel of a boat at sea.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is dead, captain.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“We can take it for granted that he is dead, and toss
him over.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do that, but something may happen. We
will get rid of him. I feel very uncomfortable at having
him on board anyhow.”</p>

<p>“It’s big money if he goes over, captain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s all right. He’ll never step foot on
land again, but the question is, how can we dispose of
him?”</p>

<p>“Throw him over.”</p>

<p>“He may be able to swim.”</p>

<p>“We can weight him.”</p>

<p>“No, he is a human being. That would be drowning
him as we would a dog.”</p>

<p>“What’s the odds?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got your voice down, Mister Man,” was the mental
conclusion of our little hero, and he muttered:</p>

<p>“Some day I will get even with you if we ever meet
again. I’ll remember you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you can do, cap.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>“Let him lie where he is.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>“He will die. We will forget all about him, find him
dead and toss him over.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of that.”</p>

<p>Ike thought that if he were consulted and had his choice
he would rather be drowned like a dog&mdash;much rather&mdash;than
cruelly starved to death in that dark ship’s hold.</p>

<p>The hatch was replaced and our hero was alone, and he
commenced to consider. He studied by feeling the chains
which bound him, and he soon assured himself that he
could get free at any time he saw fit. At the same time
he decided that he must be very careful and not take
advantage of his privilege too rashly.</p>

<p>“I will lay low until night,” he said.</p>

<p>It was a cold prospect for the poor lad to think of&mdash;lying
there all day hungry and wounded, for his head did ache a
little, owing to a blow he had received. He had discovered
also that he had bled freely. The stain had not been
washed off, and had dried on him, and he knew he presented
a horrible sight.</p>

<p>“It may aid me,” he muttered, as he realized the fact,
“to come the ghost act on ’em.”</p>

<p>As the hours passed the lad became very hungry and
thirsty, and so intense became his thirst he was almost
inclined to cry out and ask for water, although the act
might hasten his end. But as it turned out he was not
altogether deserted by the fates.</p>

<p>It is an old saying that it is better to be born lucky than
rich, and it would seem that some men and boys exemplify
the old saw. Ike appeared to be one of these, for just at
the moment when he thought he could stand the craving
for a drink no longer a thin ray of light shot down into
the darkness, and the next instant something struck against
his head. He reached up and grasped a bottle, and
attached to the bottle was a piece of bread.</p>

<p>“I have a friend at court,” was the lad’s declaration, as<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
he realized that some one had taken pity on him and had
lowered the bottle and sandwich surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Ike was a hopeful little fellow and he muttered:</p>

<p>“This means something&mdash;it means that it is not ‘all up’
with me after all. I am going to get out of this scrape, and
then, by ginger, some one will wish they had been wiped
out in a cyclone.”</p>

<p>Our hero ate and drank, and crawling away from his
stake as far as he could he hid the bottle with the remark:</p>

<p>“I do not know just when I may have a visitor. I’ll be
on my guard and not get my friend into trouble.”</p>

<p>Having satisfied his hunger the boy went to sleep, and
slept very peacefully. He was waiting for night, and when
he awoke he thought that night must be just closing in if
not actually shadowed down upon the earth and the sea.
He lay for a long time and finally concluded he would
investigate. He had little difficulty in freeing himself,
and he crept up the steps to the hatch cover and was able
to move it just a little. He peeped out and saw it was
night&mdash;a dark, rainy night&mdash;and after peeping awhile he
gently moved the hatch aside and crawled on deck. All
his movements were as cautious as a Pawnee Indian scout’s.
He did not restore the hatch cover, but just lay on his
back and took observations.</p>

<p>He learned that his conclusions had been correct. He
was on a schooner, and, as he discerned, a rickety old affair
at that. A little while he lay and considered. He could
see the man at the wheel, and there was not another person
on deck&mdash;not even a lookout. The night was calm and a
light rain was falling, but there was no fog. The lights
were all set and it was evident the ship’s crew believed
there was no danger, and thus violated one of the first laws
of navigation. Well, those laws are often violated, and in
thousands of cases the violators have paid the penalty with
their lives, while many possibly may have escaped and thus
their violations never became known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>As Ike lay on the damp deck he thought over his plan
and revised it. He managed to secure a few articles lying
around. These he slowly and patiently dragged over to
the hatch and managed to lower them one at a time. Then
he descended carefully, removed his clothing, and rigged
up a perfect dummy of himself. He had the knack of
doing so. He adjusted the chain to his dummy, which he
put in a sleeping attitude, and then he laughed and
muttered:</p>

<p>“It may not work, but I guess it will. Anyhow it is my
best card at present.”</p>

<p>Having arranged his dummy the lad stole on deck and
then crawled aft to the cabin, and he did so without being
seen. He was in his shirt and drawers only, and presented
quite a ghostly appearance. He walked half down the
companion way and glanced into the cabin. The captain
lay asleep in a berth and the mate lay on the floor of the
cabin&mdash;at least the man whom our hero took for the
mate, and the fellow for whom he had laid away a little
revenge memory.</p>

<p>It was quite a risky position for the boy. If the night
had been an absolutely clear one he would have had a chance
to learn how far they were off shore, and then he might
have decided to take a chance to steal the yawl and row or
paddle ashore. But owing to the rain he could not see to
the shore, and determined to work another scheme. He
crawled around to the side of the cabin projection near the
poop window and fortunately found a roll of canvas.</p>

<p>“This is fine,” he muttered, and in a little time he was
hidden under the canvas and then soliloquized:</p>

<p>“Here we are, and here goes.”</p>

<p>The mate lay on the floor and the captain in his berth,
and suddenly the mate started up. He looked around
wildly a moment, and then rising to his feet approached
the berth where the captain lay, and shook him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“What in thunder is the matter?” demanded the captain
springing to a sitting position.</p>

<p>“Were you dreaming, captain?”</p>

<p>“Dreaming? No, what’s the matter with you? I was
sleeping like an infant.”</p>

<p>“You were groaning hard, captain.”</p>

<p>“Let me alone, you fool. I weren’t dreaming or
groaning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did groan.”</p>

<p>“Go off, and keep quiet.”</p>

<p>The captain settled back and was soon fast asleep. The
mate listened a moment and then spread himself on the
floor again and he had just closed his eyes when up he
leaped again and ran to the captain and shook him again.</p>

<p>“There, captain, you did groan that time.”</p>

<p>“Say, man, you’ve got ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t got ’em, but I tell you that you groaned
like a dying man.”</p>

<p>“You have been dreaming yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me alone and don’t wake me again, do you
hear? or I’ll hit you.”</p>

<p>The captain settled back again to sleep and the mate
after waiting some little time also stretched upon the floor
once more. He closed his eyes and after listening for fully
five minutes was about to drop off into a sleep when he
heard a cry for help. He leaped to his feet and despite
the captain’s admonition shook him again. The captain
was real angry.</p>

<p>“Hang you, man!” he said; “I’ll knock you down.”</p>

<p>“Captain, something is the matter with you. The
moment you close your eyes you cry for help.”</p>

<p>“It’s you, not me; <em>you</em> are dreaming.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And you hear me call for help?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“I am in earnest.”</p>

<p>“This is no joke?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got ’em.”</p>

<p>“I swear I am as clear as a bell.”</p>

<p>“And you hear me call?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You swear to it?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You’re up to something.”</p>

<p>“Captain, on my life I am telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“We will see.”</p>

<p>The captain lay down and the mate after awhile lay
down also, when suddenly, as it appeared, the mate called
for help. The captain leaped from his berth and sprang
beside the mate but the latter was wide awake.</p>

<p>“There, captain, you did it again.”</p>

<p>The captain laughed, and said: “It’s just as I told you&mdash;it
was you who groaned and called.”</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I didn’t. I have not been asleep.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I, and I just lay low and watched.”</p>

<p>“So did I.”</p>

<p>“Is this a game you are working?”</p>

<p>“I swear I am not.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try again. We’ll both watch.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The captain got in his berth and the mate stretched on
the floor, and fully five minutes passed. Finally the captain
demanded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“Well, old man, have you been asleep?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t hear it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I, so you see you’ve been fooled or you’ve
been dreaming yourself.”</p>

<p>The captain was just settling back for an undisturbed
snooze when suddenly he leaped from his berth, his face
pale and his eyes starting. The mate also leaped to his
feet and demanded:</p>

<p>“What is it, captain?”</p>

<p>For a moment the captain could not speak. He was
trembling like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>“Tell me, captain, what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What did you hear?”</p>

<p>“A groan.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the bed there, close to my ear.”</p>

<p>“Aha, captain, you fell asleep.”</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I was not asleep.”</p>

<p>“And you heard a groan?”</p>

<p>“I did, and I won’t get in that berth again.”</p>

<p>“I will, captain. I tell you you’ve been dreaming. It
was your own voice you heard.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you were wide awake?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sleep on the floor&mdash;you sleep in the berth.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>The mate got in the berth, but in less than a second he
leaped forth with a yell, and the captain, who had stretched
upon the floor, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, mate?”</p>

<p>“Captain, I heard it.”</p>

<p>“What did you hear?”</p>

<p>“A voice.”</p>

<p>“You heard a voice?”</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I did.”</p>

<p>“And what did the voice say?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t stop to hear.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try it; you watch beside me.”</p>

<p>“All right, captain, I’ll stand right here.”</p>

<p>The captain lay down in the berth and the mate stood
at his side, but nothing was heard.</p>

<p>“We’ve both been fooled,” said the captain. “Lie
down, it’s all right.”</p>

<p>The mate stepped away, but he had not got more than
two feet distant when once more the captain leaped from
the berth.</p>

<p>The two men gazed into each other’s faces and finally
the captain asked:</p>

<p>“Is it a judgment on us?”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Receiving that boy on board. Mebbe the boy is dead
and is haunting us.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I want you to take a lantern and go see.”</p>

<p>Ike had leaped to his feet and he ran along the rail and
got down into the brig in no time. He covered himself
up under his dummy and waited, and a few moments later
the hatch was slid away.</p>

<p>“Say, who is up there?” demanded Ike.</p>

<p>The man appeared delighted.</p>

<p>“Help there!” called Ike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said the mate. “What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want something to eat.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it as soon as the cook is stirring about.”</p>

<p>“All right, don’t forget me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>The mate slid back the cover and returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“The boy is all right&mdash;lively as a cricket.”</p>

<p>“He is?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is calling for something to eat and hang it, I
don’t blame him. Probably he don’t know how long he’s
been there. If he did he’d be starved to death sure.
Here’s a case, captain, where ignorance is bliss.”</p>

<p>“But how about the voice?”</p>

<p>“There is where you’ve got me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard the schooner was haunted. It is said that
years ago the captain, mate, and a sailor were murdered on
this boat. I never could prove it true because her name
was changed.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that her name was changed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true.”</p>

<p>“You know that?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Then the other story may be true.”</p>

<p>“I’ve owned her for three years.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve never had any luck in her?”</p>

<p>“Neither any one else who ever owned her. I thought I
might make her pay when others had failed. I’ll give it
up and sell her as quick as I can.”</p>

<p>“Say, captain,” said the mate in a husky voice, “mebbe
this is the boat in which Hicks the pirate murdered the
captain.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, that’s what I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are not much better.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got that boy on board and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that moment a voice was heard. Captain and mate
stood and glared and trembled, and as both stood there on
the center of the cabin floor, a voice came from the berth.
It was clear, firm and distinct and there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>“Put about,” the voice proclaimed. “I was once
captain of this boat. I was murdered on board her. I
don’t want another murder committed, and if any harm
comes to the boy you have on board both you men will
hang. There were witnesses, there will be witnesses. Get
him ashore as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>The two men stood and gazed as though indeed they
were listening to the voice of one who had passed beyond
and was talking back from the land of mystery.</p>

<p>“Heed my words,” spoke the mysterious voice in conclusion,
and then all was still.</p>

<p>“Captain,” after a long time spoke the mate, “we are in
luck.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“We have been warned.”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We’ll land the lad.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“This very night.”</p>

<p>“How can we?”</p>

<p>“We are not more than two miles off the Long Island
shore; you know we’ve been hovering around here.”</p>

<p>“Say, captain, you will lose your money.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it; don’t propose to have dead men haunting
me for all the money in the world.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take chances.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Run down off Fire Island light, put the lad in a yawl
and send him adrift. He may reach shore, he may not.<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
If he does you are clear of the dead men; if he don’t it
ain’t your fault. But I’ve one thing to say.”</p>

<p>“All right, speak right out.”</p>

<p>“I’d chance the dead men, I would.”</p>

<p>The words had hardly left the mate’s lips when right at
his ear there sounded a yell that almost froze the blood in
his veins. He stood and trembled like a Macbeth gazing
upon the apparition of a Banquo.</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated the captain, “you don’t mind being
haunted by dead men, eh?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” pleaded the mate.</p>

<p>“This boat is haunted, that’s sure. There’s no luck in
her and I shall sell her as quick as I can, and I shall get
rid of that boy, money or no money. And besides I’ve got
an idea; yes, I have. Those fellows might ‘bilk’ me if
anything did happen to the lad, and they might haunt me
and blackmail me. It’s all bad business. I never intended
that any real harm should come to the lad anyhow. You
were the devil who urged me on, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this instant again there sounded a yell in the ear of
the mate and he shouted:</p>

<p>“Get the boy ashore. I’ll row him ashore; yes, I will.”</p>

<p>Ike got back to his place, cast aside his dummy and got
into his clothes. And he wasn’t a minute too soon, either.
Before the hatch cover was removed and the captain started
to come down the lad leaped to his feet, seized the chain
from which he had released himself, and ran back to one
corner saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me.” And he raised the chain
threateningly.</p>

<p>The captain held his lantern aloft and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t fear, lad, I mean you no harm. I’ve done you
a kindness.”</p>

<p>“You have, eh?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>“How? By starving me almost to death?”</p>

<p>“I ordered them to feed you.”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t obey you.”</p>

<p>“I see you are free.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Who freed you?”</p>

<p>“I freed myself and I intended to jump overboard.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that.”</p>

<p>“You are all right.”</p>

<p>“I am?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean to land you.”</p>

<p>“You mean to land me?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“I am heading in toward shore now. You will be all
right.”</p>

<p>“Why did you bring me aboard here?”</p>

<p>“We found you lying in the street. We did not know
what to do with you, and brought you aboard.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you treat me well?”</p>

<p>“Because we feared we might be pursued by the rascals
who knocked you down.”</p>

<p>It was a weak explanation the captain made, but our
hero did not see that he could gain anything by disputing
or arguing, and he said:</p>

<p>“I am hungry.”</p>

<p>“You shall have something to eat right away. I’ve laid
off my course so as to put you ashore as soon as it was safe.”</p>

<p>Ike did not deem it necessary to dispute this latter statement
but said:</p>

<p>“Feed me, please.”</p>

<p>The captain led him up to the deck, took him back to
the cabin and did offer him some food, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>“It will be all right when you get ashore. And say, lad,
I don’t want you ever to say anything about your being on
my boat. I swear I did all to save your life; yes, I did.”</p>

<p>Ike was not disposed to dispute anything that the captain
said. All he desired was to get ashore. He believed
a great mystery had opened up in New York which he
could solve, and he was anxious to get to the city as quickly
as he could.</p>

<p>A couple of hours passed. It was just a little before
dawn when the captain hauled to off the Fire Island lighthouse.
He had given directions to his men where to meet
him. Ike was standing on the deck when a lad came stealing
up close to him, who whispered:</p>

<p>“I gave you the water and bread. Don’t ever tell on
me or they will kill me.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Jim Banta.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to this schooner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, I am going to get off her as quick as I can.”</p>

<p>“You did me a good turn.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Some day you may come to New York.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get there as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>“We may meet again.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, and then I’ll tell you something.”</p>

<p>“And I may tell you something,” said Ike.</p>

<p>Our hero had taken in the lad’s face and he was assured
that he would recognize him should they ever meet again.</p>

<p>The yawl had been hauled alongside and our hero got
in and was followed by the captain of the schooner, who
commanded his men to “lay to” awhile.</p>

<p>“Boy, remember,” said the captain, “I was your friend.”</p>

<p>“All right, captain, mebbe you are proving it now.”</p>

<p>“I did intend to take you down east, but I changed my
mind. I would have done so in your own interest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all right, captain, as far as it goes.”</p>

<p>There were a number of boats flying around here and
there on the water, and the captain said:</p>

<p>“Mebbe I can get you on one of those boats. They have
pleasure fisherman on board, out after bluefish. There
will be no fish to-day, and they will run in early, and you
will be all right. But remember you are not to say anything
about me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, captain, you need have no fear.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could do more for you, but I believe I have
saved your life, and if we ever meet again I will tell you
all about it.”</p>

<p>Ike was thinking of but one thing&mdash;the possibilities
attending the attack on young Burlein a few moments
preceding the moment when he received the blow which
knocked him insensible.</p>

<p>In the meantime the captain had kept on talking and
pulling his boat, and Ike noticed quite a large catboat bearing
down upon them, and soon she came within hailing
distance. When the captain called to them the men on
the fishing boat, a merry party, brought their boat to and
the captain pulled alongside and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve a lad here I picked up off shore. Will you gentlemen
take him aboard and land him?”</p>

<p>The men were in a jolly mood and bid Ike “come
aboard.” The lad was glad to do so, and waved the captain
an adieu as the latter, without stopping to make any
further explanations, pulled away in his yawl.</p>

<p>The party on the fishing boat had caught one big fish,
and they were, as intimated, in a very jolly mood. They
asked Ike a few questions, accepted whatever he had to
say, and went on with their fun.</p>

<p>Our hero had plenty to eat and could have had plenty to
drink if he had so desired. It was well on toward noon
when the men determined to head for the inlet and go<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
ashore. It had been decided that they would catch no
more fish that day.</p>

<p>Most of the forenoon they had bowled along under a
good stiff breeze, but suddenly the wind all died out and
they lay in a dead calm, and as is usual they commenced
all manner of sport. Ike thought he had seen about every
gambling game that had ever been played, but he learned
a new one that day, and a very amusing one. The party
were all gentlemen out for an excursion, and they were in
for fun, and our hero determined before that boat reached
shore he would give them lots of fun. Our hero was a
practical joker. He just enjoyed the possession of his
wonderful gifts and he never missed an opportunity to play
a trick&mdash;not malignant ones but just simple little jokes.
As stated he was an expert handler of cards and well up in
all manner of games, and therefore he greatly enjoyed the
one organized by the fishing party. There were a great
number of flies buzzing in the cabin and the men all took
a lump of sugar, laid their several pieces on the table
before them. Then each man laid a penny by his lump,
and the man who owned the sugar on which the first fly
lit took the pot. The game was called by the men “hop
fly loo.”</p>

<p>They had considerable sport over this little game, but
at length got tired, and still the calm held on. They
lolled around on the boat and before them lay the solitary
bluefish&mdash;a big fellow, their only reward for the expense
they had been to for the day.</p>

<p>As intimated, a dead calm prevailed and the men were
listless, and, like a lot of boys, hardly knew what to do,
when one of them asked:</p>

<p>“If that big bluefish could talk, I wonder what he
would say?”</p>

<p>One of the men answered:</p>

<p>“He would say, a healthy stomach had got him in more
trouble than a fish who had the dyspepsia too bad to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>The men all laughed in the most hearty manner. The
conceit was a good one, and another of the party put in:</p>

<p>“If he could speak he would say: ‘I tried to hook your
bait, and, alas! you hooked me.’”</p>

<p>A third chipped in.</p>

<p>“He’d say: ‘Better an empty stomach than a treacherous
meal.’” And so the jokes went on, one saying:</p>

<p>“He’d say: ‘I wish I’d been too full for utterance, and
then I’d have let your bait go by.’”</p>

<p>Each joke received the laughter it deserved, and finally
the man who had offered the first suggestion projected his
query again with the remark:</p>

<p>“It would be a big thing to hear that fish express his
thoughts.”</p>

<p>At that instant there sounded a strange flapping like the
sound of a bird in its flight.</p>

<p>The men all looked around. There was no bird in sight.
They looked in each other’s faces, for indeed it was a
most wonderful incident. All had heard it, and even
while they looked there came the cry of “quack, quack,”
of a wild duck, and the “quack, quack, quack,” sounded
right over their heads. They strained their eyes&mdash;there
was no duck in sight; indeed, it was not the season for
ducks. They were all sportsmen, and they knew that,
and yet the flapping of wings was plainly heard, and the
“quack, quack,” of the duck, as plainly as a tame duck’s
quack on the edge of a farm pond.</p>

<p>“Eh, boys, what does it mean? Who shot the last duck?”</p>

<p>“Who did?” the inquiry went round.</p>

<p>“And why?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Because we are haunted by the ghost of a duck, sure.”</p>

<p>The men were all attention. They had all looked at
and watched each other to see who, if any of them had
imitated the flapping, and who it was who was doing the
quack, quack, business. Not one of the party could be<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
accused. They were all sitting face to face, and in their
midst sat Ike. Not a lip moved, and the quack, quack,
continued. It was impossible that any one of the party
could have worked the trick and not have been betrayed.</p>

<p>“Say, boys,” said one of the men, “this is rather odd,
whatever you may say.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe there is a duck in the cabin.”</p>

<p>The captain of the boat, who was very pale and looked
quite serious, said:</p>

<p>“There is no duck on this boat, and I don’t like it. I
wish you gentlemen would stop your joking. Captain
Brown heard a duck quack just before that blow when he
and all on board were drowned.”</p>

<p>The party thought the captain was working something on
them, and they commenced to joke worse than ever, and
it was still a dead calm.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a big blow,” said the captain.
“I wish we were in the inlet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off, cap.”</p>

<p>At this moment the quack, quack, was heard again.</p>

<p>All the men began to feel a little uncomfortable. They
were intelligent men, but the circumstance was certainly
very odd, and it was still more startling when a voice
from over the top of the mast appeared to call down
and say:</p>

<p>“Ask the bluefish what he has to say.”</p>

<p>The party looked in each other’ faces. In dead earnest,
of course, all hands believed some trick was being worked
on them, and yet it was certainly a very weird trick&mdash;and
it did not seem possible that it could be worked. One of
the party said, however:</p>

<p>“Let’s obey orders; we’ll ask the bluefish what he has
to say.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll ask him?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“All right, watch each other,” and looking at the bluefish
he asked: “Old father blue, what have you to say?”</p>

<p>The whole scene was intended as a joke, but there was a
surprised crowd in that boat when, in a strangely weird
voice, the answer seemingly came from the fish:</p>

<p>“If I’d had my breakfast earlier you’d never have caught
me.”</p>

<p>Of course it was a joke, of course somebody was working
it with a marvelous skill, but who was doing it? The
gentlemen had all known each other for many years and
none of them knew that any one of them possessed the
wonderful talent of ventriloquism, and in fact they did not
believe that such a marvelous gift was possessed by any
one not the best of magicians. Still there was the fish,
and still there did appear to come from him the startling
response to the question.</p>

<p>“Try him again,” said one.</p>

<p>“You try him.”</p>

<p>“What’s your game, fish?” asked the man.</p>

<p>The answer appeared to come:</p>

<p>“You fellows snatched me from the sea for food, but
my relatives will <em>dine on you all before this time to-morrow</em>.”</p>

<p>Oh, it was a trick&mdash;yes, all a trick, but just marvelous
enough to make the men feel very uncomfortable, the circumstance
was so weird and strange. In fact, one of the
party, a very nervous man, fainted, and when he was
brought round the oldest gentleman present and the one
who appeared to be most respected said:</p>

<p>“Come, this has gone far enough. Whoever is working
this wonderful trick had better explain it.”</p>

<p>The gentleman spoke in dead earnest, but not one of the
party volunteered to admit his responsibility, and the gentleman
pleaded:</p>

<p>“It is criminal to carry this any further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>There came no acknowledgment and all the men began
to look pretty serious, and to add to the gloom the captain,
pointing to a cloud coming in from the sea, said in apprehensive
tones:</p>

<p>“It’s just as I feared. We are bound to have a terrible
storm. Now if any one has been working a trick let him
own it up, or, by George, we’re all goners, that’s all.”</p>

<p>There came the bark of a dog and immediately afterward
the terrible moan of an animal, the same as tradition
declares is heard just before a death&mdash;a howl which
in rural districts to-day is heard with a shudder, and looked
upon as a death knell.</p>

<p>After the first strange voice our hero had gone into the
cabin and had lain down on a cushion in full view of the
party and had seemingly gone to sleep. Several times the
men had looked at him, but that sleeping boy could not be
the fiend who was working on their terrors, for there he slept
and was breathing as regularly as an infant lying on its
mother’s bosom.</p>

<p>“Who is that boy?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, who is he?” asked the captain’s assistant.</p>

<p>“Wake him up,” said one of the party.</p>

<p>The captain’s mate did arouse Ike, who rose and rubbed
his eyes so naturally that every one decided at once that
no matter whether it were trick or reality the lad knew
nothing about it; and yet it was the most remarkable
occurrence that any of them had ever encountered in all
their lives.</p>

<p>The captain said:</p>

<p>“It’s that boy.” He made the declaration despite the
fact that Ike had been aroused, and awoke so naturally,
and the captain repeated:</p>

<p>“It’s that boy or the devil, or it’s the devil or that
boy.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>The captain was glaring wildly as he said:</p>

<p>“That boy is the devil. We had no right to take him
on board. Throw him over. He won’t drown.”</p>

<p>There came a voice saying:</p>

<p>“Throw him over and you will have the hurricane of
your life, and none of you will ever reach shore.”</p>

<p>The voice was heard and there stood the lad in their
midst, as innocent looking as a babe. One matter all
hands considered settled&mdash;the boy had nothing to do with
the mysterious occurrences.</p>

<p>They were still questioning Ike when one of the men
discovered a blood stain on his clothes.</p>

<p>The captain of the schooner had scrubbed off the lad’s
clothes, but one stain escaped his attention, and the gentleman
who found the mark said:</p>

<p>“Hello, lad, you’ve been bleeding.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The captain said he picked you up.”</p>

<p>“I know he did.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“The captain lied, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“Not a word. It’s no time for me to talk.”</p>

<p>The cloud which had been rising in the west meantime
began to increase and spread, and the sound of distant
thunder was heard. The captain of the yacht looked pale
and troubled as he said:</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a regular cyclone. I wish we were in
the inlet.”</p>

<p>All the party began to betray signs of uneasiness, when
there came a little ripple over the sea. The captain did
not dare run with full sail, but he took in several reefs and
shortened his jib sail, and the boat moved away like a thing
of life toward the inlet.</p>

<p>Ike had been to sea a great deal and had met with considerable
experience and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Captain, you’re wrong.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“You will just get in the inlet when the storm strikes
us, and we will be blown on to a bar, and then it’s all up&mdash;it’s
sink or swim.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Reef her down to a pigeon wing and let her run before
the wind. It’s your only chance.”</p>

<p>One of the party, who had also had some experience,
said:</p>

<p>“The lad is right.”</p>

<p>The captain answered:</p>

<p>“I reckon I know my business.”</p>

<p>Ike stood a moment and then asked:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, have you hired this boat?”</p>

<p>The answer came, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then take my advice; take command of her or this
man will run you to certain death. He’s lost his head.”</p>

<p>The party was composed of a number of intelligent and
resolute men and one of them said:</p>

<p>“Here, captain, face her about.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. Ike suddenly leaped forward,
and without a word of warning dealt the captain a blow
over the head with a death club used for knocking big fish
on the head. The captain rolled over to the bottom of the
boat and Ike seized the helm and brought the craft around.
He then asked one of the men to hold the helm while he
hauled in the jib, and asked the others to reef the sail
down to a pigeon wing. All hands obeyed and they were
just in time, for a minute later the squall struck them and
away flew the little yacht over the foaming waves.</p>

<p>Our hero had resumed the helm, and he held her steady
to the wind.</p>

<p>The captain had sought to regain his feet, but the men<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
held him down and bid him lie still, and away they sped
over the waters.</p>

<p>It proved to be only a summer tempest, and in half an
hour the blow was over, and under a steady breeze Ike put
her about and made a run for the inlet.</p>

<p>But little had been said during the excitement. The
captain was released and sullenly took his helm, when one
of the party said:</p>

<p>“Cap, the boy saved our lives by his prompt action.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of the boy,” growled the captain.</p>

<p>“See here, cap, it’s all right. We will pay you for the
rap you received.”</p>

<p>The men made up a purse of twenty dollars over and
above the hire of the boat, and got the captain to agree to
say nothing about it.</p>

<p>At the time Ike took his prompt action two other boats
were making for the inlet. They were just ahead of the
boat our hero was on, and when our party reached shore
they learned the sad intelligence that both boats had run
into the inlet, had been caught, blown over and that seven
men and a boy were drowned. Had the boat on which Ike
was gone on she too would have gone over, and probably a
few more would have been added to the death list.</p>

<p>The men all appreciated the fact and also that they
owed their salvation to Ike’s extraordinary and prompt
action. And the result was they made up a purse of fifty
dollars and presented it to him, and each man gave his
card to our hero with an invitation to call on them.</p>

<p>It was after dark when the party went ashore and all
hurried to a train for New York. Ike went with them
and a little before midnight he appeared at his home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell, despite his warning that he might unexpectedly
be away for days at a time, was greatly worried and
rejoiced when he showed up. She had been waiting for
him as she had done on the two preceding nights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>Ike did not see fit to make a full explanation. He
merely said he was full of business and on to a big thing.</p>

<p>After reporting as stated he stole forth. He desired to
see a newspaper. He knew that something had occurred
and he desired to get on to it if he could.</p>

<p>He found a saloon open and secured a paper, and the
first item that met his eyes was the startling announcement:</p>

<p class="center p1">A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE. A PROMINENT
BANKER MISSING.
</p>

<p class="p1">“Aha! just as I thought,” muttered the lad, and he
carefully read the article through. There were interviews
and speculations as usual, and also several very dark and
peculiar suggestions, and they all emanated from Mr. Fellman,
the partner of the missing man. There were suggestions
of suicide, escape to Canada, and indeed several
very startling theories; and the lad muttered:</p>

<p>“It is just as I thought. I had this thing down pretty
well. The chances are Burlein is dead&mdash;murdered in cold
blood&mdash;his body in the river; and all might have been prevented
had he only heeded my warning. But we shall see.
To-morrow the papers will have more to announce, and I&mdash;well
I won’t say anything at present, <em>but I’ll act</em>.”</p>

<p>On the day following the incidents recorded Ike was out
bright and early. He secured a morning paper and the
whole thing was out. Burlein was a thief. An examination
of the firm’s books had revealed the fact that he had
speculated on private account with the firm’s money. He
had sought to hide his losses by falsification of the books and
had committed downright forgery.</p>

<p>Great sympathy was expressed for his victim, Fellman,
and offers of aid and indulgence on the part of creditors
were made on every side.</p>

<p>Ike read the account with great eagerness, and when he<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
had digested the account he began to revolve matters in
his mind, and he said:</p>

<p>“The first thing I will do is see the young lady.”</p>

<p>It had been stated in the paper that Burlein had been
engaged to marry a young heiress, and one of the most
beautiful ladies in New York. It was also hinted that her
father was a heavy loser and a victim of the young man’s
forgeries.</p>

<p>Ike had fifty dollars. He went to work and provided
himself with the necessary articles for a perfect disguise.
He got himself up as a respectable old lady. His genius in
the way of disguise was simply immense. He went around
to the house where he knew the young lady resided. He
had little difficulty in learning her father’s name. It was
common enough&mdash;simply Alexander Smith.</p>

<p>Ike went up the stoop of the house, rang the bell and
stated that he desired to see Miss Smith.</p>

<p>The maid who attended on the door retired, but in a few
moments returned and stated that Miss Smith was ill and
could not see any one that day.</p>

<p>Our hero had prepared himself, and he handed the girl
a note, telling her to deliver it. The note read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It’s all false. I am a friend of Burlein. I can explain
much to you. I must see you.</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-left:5em">“<span class="smcap">A Friend of Alfred Burlein.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>A few moments later and the maid returned, stating
that Miss Smith would see the lady.</p>

<p>Our hero was shown into the rear library and after some
time a very handsome and stately looking young lady, who
had evidently been weeping and who was in great distress,
appeared. She said:</p>

<p>“I received your note.”</p>

<p>“And I am glad you granted me an interview.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>Ike’s disguise, as stated, was perfect, and besides he acted
his role to perfection.</p>

<p>“What have you to say?” came the question.</p>

<p>“I have this to say: Burlein is innocent of all the
charges made against him.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter. What I tell you is the truth.”</p>

<p>“You say he is innocent?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can you prove his innocence?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Why not do so at once, and stop these terrible stories
that are going around about him?”</p>

<p>“We must go slow, miss.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“A mere declaration of his innocence is not enough.
We must be prepared to prove his innocence and establish
the guilt of his enemy.”</p>

<p>“His enemy did you say?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“He has an enemy?”</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>“Who is his enemy?”</p>

<p>“The man who has started these charges.”</p>

<p>“His partner makes the charges.”</p>

<p>“His partner is a villain.”</p>

<p>The young lady started and gazed aghast and declared:</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“I fear you are mistaken. I do not know what object
his partner would have in defaming him.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish his innocence established?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“If he is alive we can fully establish his innocence.”</p>

<p>“If he is alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If he is innocent he must be alive. He would not
make away with himself if he is innocent.”</p>

<p>“No, but he has an enemy.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He may have been foully dealt with.”</p>

<p>“You are using strange language, madam.”</p>

<p>“I am, but I know exactly what I say and what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come here? You had a purpose in coming
here.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What is your purpose?”</p>

<p>“Merely to tell you under all circumstances to hold fast
your faith in Alfred Burlein.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me who you are, and your special
interest in the young man?”</p>

<p>“Some day you will know who I am. He was my
friend, I am his friend, and I tell you he is innocent. I
tell you further his partner is a villain.”</p>

<p>“What object could he have in defaming the missing
man?”</p>

<p>“Can you not discern?”</p>

<p>“I cannot.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>“He is the thief, the forger, <em>and he desires to cover his
own guilt</em>.”</p>

<p>The young lady looked amazed and our hero added:</p>

<p>“I wonder that you could for one moment believe these
terrible stories.”</p>

<p>“I did not believe them, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on, miss.”</p>

<p>“The proofs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What proofs?”</p>

<p>“The proofs of his guilt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“Who has seen them?”</p>

<p>“My father.”</p>

<p>“They were shown to your father by Fellman?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They are false.”</p>

<p>“My father says they are absolute.”</p>

<p>“Your father has been misled.”</p>

<p>“I hope what you say is true.”</p>

<p>“I am telling you the truth. I will establish the innocence
of Alfred Burlein.”</p>

<p>“What can I do to aid you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You do not need my aid?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“You can call upon me.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not need your aid. All I ask is that you save
yourself much distress and maintain your faith in the
missing man.”</p>

<p>“You suggest it is possible he has been foully dealt with.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Have you grounds for your belief?”</p>

<p>“I have one proof.”</p>

<p>“Will you talk with my father? Oh, please do.”</p>

<p>“Not now; but you can ask your father to withhold his
judgment for the present. Tell him you still have faith
in the young man, and I promise you that if he is alive
your faith will be verified.”</p>

<p>Ike would not reveal any further to the young lady.
He merely reiterated his statement that he had called to
restore her peace of mind. He left the house and determined
to work Fellman for awhile, and proceeded down
town. He imagined his man would go to his meal in
company with another. Ike got himself up in a new
disguise and went down and hung around the man’s office,
and, as he had anticipated, in due time Fellman appeared<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
in company with another man, and proceeded to a fashionable
down-town lunch-room.</p>

<p>Ike had a special purpose in following the man. He
desired to learn if young Burlein was dead, and he proposed
to adopt a very novel plan for obtaining his information.</p>

<p>Fellman entered the dining-room and immediately a
number of men came forward to speak to him. Great
sympathy was expressed and Fellman acted the rôle of the
injured party to perfection.</p>

<p>The banker took a seat at a table. Our hero had followed
in and secured a seat several tables distant. He had
worked up in the rôle of an old gentleman. He did it
well, and he was a perfect imitation or counterfeit. Possibly
no living person could have excelled or even equaled
him in his skill in this direction.</p>

<p>A little time passed and quite a number of men gathered
around Fellman’s table, and a great many questions were
asked and finally there came the question:</p>

<p>“Do you really believe your late partner is dead?”</p>

<p>No one appeared to notice who had asked the question
but Fellman quickly replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, he is dead. I have no doubt of his death.”</p>

<p>There came a smile to Ike’s face&mdash;a smile of delight. He
was a cute reasoner, and he made up his mind at once that
young Burlein was not dead. Had the young man been
dead Fellman he knew would have answered: “No, he is
not dead. He is only pretending to have committed
suicide.” And when he answered that he had no doubt of
Burlein’s death, our hero concluded that the original
scheme had been carried out, and at once there came the
question:</p>

<p>“Do you own a house out on Long Island?”</p>

<p>Fellman’s face assumed a ghastly hue. He looked
around and finally demanded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>“Who asked that question?”</p>

<p>No one fathered the question, and Fellman appeared
greatly perplexed. An instant later, however, the question
was repeated:</p>

<p>“Do you own a house on Long Island?”</p>

<p>All the party looked round to see who had asked the
question, and Fellman, in a tone seemingly of anger, but
really of alarm, again demanded:</p>

<p>“Who asked that question?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know,” demanded Fellman, “who asked that
question.”</p>

<p>A voice said, “No matter who asked the question.
Answer it.”</p>

<p>Fellman leaped to his feet and pleaded:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, will you tell me who asked that question?”</p>

<p>No one appeared willing or able to tell him. But the
voice once more put in:</p>

<p>“Have you a house down on Long Island?”</p>

<p>Fellman looked over to some of the other tables. No
one appeared to have put the question, but the voice again
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, you villain, you know very well the young man is
not dead. Yes, you do.”</p>

<p>Fellman appeared like one confronted by an apparition.
The perspiration stood out on his face, and he said:</p>

<p>“The scoundrel who says that is a liar.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen who had gathered around one by one
dropped away. They appeared to think that a row was
imminent, especially when the voice repeated.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice job you’ve put up.”</p>

<p>It is hard to describe the effect of the strange voice on
Fellman. He did not suspect any supernatural agency,
nor did he suspect ventriloquism. He merely suspected
that some person in the crowd was shouting off the questions,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
and he believed that whoever it was the party was
representing the real sentiments of some people who had
thus expressed themselves concerning the mystery. He
was a cunning man. He did not propose to remain around
and be “guyed” and he left the lunch-room without even
stopping to say good-day to his friend.</p>

<p>Meantime our hero had gathered up all he needed to
know. He was assured that Burlein still lived and was
beyond question an inmate of that mysterious country
house.</p>

<p>Ike considered a long time, and finally decided upon his
course of action. He knew he could trace the affair down
and might possibly succeed in freeing young Burlein from
confinement, but he knew the full advantage of evidence.
He calculated that Fellman had laid his plans well and
was well fortified for the carrying out of his scheme. Ike
had often heard of a well-known detective and he had
evidence that the officer was a square man. The boy knew
that a fair reward would be paid. Indeed Fellman had
offered a reward of five thousand dollars for his partner
alive, or conclusive evidence of his death.</p>

<p>Ike proceeded down to headquarters. He visited the
detective quarters and asked for the man of whom he had
heard. He was answered in an indifferent manner that
the officer was out of town.</p>

<p>“When will he be in town?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The party who made the answers was a clerk. Another
man came from a private office and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you inquire for Murray?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“You wish to see him personally?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“He will be here in about an hour.”</p>

<p>“Can I wait here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Ike sat down and not more than fifteen minutes passed
when a very plain-looking man, but who possessed a clear
gray eye and who was very quiet in his manner, entered the
office. The clerk spoke to the newcomer and pointed to
Ike. The lad was a little on his ear. He had not fancied
the indifferent manner in which the clerk had announced
him.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see me?” demanded the plain-looking
man, stepping over to where our hero was seated.</p>

<p>“Are you Detective Murray?”</p>

<p>“My name is Murray.”</p>

<p>“Well, mebbe you are the man I want to see. I don’t
know, it depends how smart you are.”</p>

<p>“I am not very smart,” said the officer with a smile.
“All I know I’ve learned by hard work.”</p>

<p>“Then you are pretty smart,” said Ike, “since you admit
that there are some people who know something and that
you don’t know it all, like that young man there.”</p>

<p>“What is your business?” demanded the detective in a
rather sharp tone.</p>

<p>“Come with me and I will tell you all about it,” said
Ike.</p>

<p>The detective meditated a moment. He was a busy man
usually, and he had no time to listen to long romances.</p>

<p>“If you have anything to say speak out, lad. I am very
busy.”</p>

<p>“Come with me and I will let you on to the job of your
life.”</p>

<p>Murray looked the youth over, and being necessarily a
keen reader of faces he concluded our hero was a very
bright youngster, as he put it.</p>

<p>Ike had spoken in a low tone, and after an interval the
detective said:</p>

<p>“Come into the office with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>“No, not there.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time, sir; time is money.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Go with me.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere away from sharp ears.”</p>

<p>“Come along.”</p>

<p>The detective went with our hero down to the street and
said:</p>

<p>“Now talk up.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What now?”</p>

<p>“We must sit down. I’ve got a long story to tell you.”</p>

<p>“See here, lad, if you fool me I’ll cuff you.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll chance the cuffing.”</p>

<p>The detective led the way to a hotel reading-room, both
sat down and the officer asked:</p>

<p>“Does this suit you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then go ahead.”</p>

<p>“You know about the disappearance of young Alfred
Burlein?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The officer was all attention at once.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Did you lead me around here to ask me that question?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a mind to cuff you.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not cuff me.”</p>

<p>“You deserve a cuffing.”</p>

<p>“If you will answer my question you will change your
mind.”</p>

<p>“I will?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“What have you to say?”</p>

<p>“Answer my question.”</p>

<p>“Make your question definite.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe he is dead?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is not dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he only skipped, eh?”</p>

<p>The officer was getting down to business.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t skip.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he?”</p>

<p>“<em>He was kidnaped.</em>”</p>

<p>The officer laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh too soon. I am not saying things for
fun.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what you are talking about?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And you say he was abducted?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“His partner.”</p>

<p>“Are you giving me a theory?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I know what I am talking about.”</p>

<p>“Then talk plain.”</p>

<p>Ike started in and told his story. The detective listened
attentively and when the narrative was concluded he said:</p>

<p>“You are a romancer.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I can prove my words.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>“I know what you doubt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>At that moment the detective made a slash at a fly, but
there was no fly there, and Ike asked:</p>

<p>“What are you doing? Are you trying to cuff me?”</p>

<p>“No, I am brushing away that fly.”</p>

<p>“Have you got ’em?” demanded Ike, assuming a very
serious tone.</p>

<p>“Got what?”</p>

<p>“You know.”</p>

<p>The fly buzzed again and the detective, who was thinking
intensely and deeply absorbed, unconsciously made a
second dash at the fly.</p>

<p>“You have got ’em,” said Ike.</p>

<p>“Got what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know. You think there are flies in the room.
Yes, you’ve got ’em. If you will find a fly in this room
I’ll give you a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>The detective stared and the next instant a little dog
barked at the officer’s feet, but there was no dog there.
Then a rattlesnake rattled right under his hand. The
officer knew well the sound of a rattler, but he was on to
that last, and he said:</p>

<p>“Boy, you are a wonder.”</p>

<p>“You believe me now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Good enough; every word I have told you is the truth;
and now I’ve got a plan.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“I gave Fellman a scare.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He will go to his house down on Long Island. He
will want to make sure that his man is there.”</p>

<p>“You are a wonderfully keen lad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got this business down fine, and now are you prepared
to leave town?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We will go down town and lay for Fellman. He will
leave on the afternoon train for Long Island, I’ll bet a big
apple.”</p>

<p>“I will meet you in half an hour,” said Murray.</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Half an hour later Ike was standing on the corner agreed
upon when he saw a country gawk approach. The latter
stepped up to our hero and asked for a certain street. Ike
was thrown off for an instant, but ere he answered he fell
to the truth and said:</p>

<p>“Bully, old man; you’re good. It’s a great scheme.”</p>

<p>Murray had assumed the guise of a country gawk and he
was amazed at the lad’s wonderful quickness in going
under his disguise. He arranged a few signals with Ike,
and then the two separated. Ike went down to the vicinity
of Fellman’s office. He had changed his own disguise
before visiting the detective. He hung around for over
an hour and then saw Fellman come forth. The banker
carried a small traveling satchel and Ike muttered:</p>

<p>“Just as I expected; he is on his way for his house down
on Long Island, and we will have young Burlein back in
New York inside twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Our hero fell to the trail of Fellman. The man went to
Roosevelt street ferry and took the Hunter’s Point boat for
Long Island City. As Ike followed on the boat, the
country gawk ran against him and Ike passed the signal,
and a little later all hands were on the train for Smithtown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Probably few people outside of Long Islanders are aware
that on Long Island there are spots as wild as in any other
part of the country, as far as isolation is concerned. Indeed
wild deer still roam in some of these recesses despite
the fact that some parts of the island are so densely
inhabited.</p>

<p>At Smithtown Fellman alighted and there was a buckboard
waiting for him. The man had found means of
communication or had expected to go down ere he got
the strange intimation in the restaurant.</p>

<p>It was evening when the train arrived and Murray said
to Ike:</p>

<p>“Boy, I know Long Island pretty well.”</p>

<p>“That’s lucky.”</p>

<p>“Are you tough?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not tender.”</p>

<p>“Then we can follow that buckboard afoot.”</p>

<p>“Good enough.”</p>

<p>The man Fellman was driven off at a pretty lively gait,
but Ike and the detective kept along pretty well until they
got beyond the hard roads of the village, when the detective
said:</p>

<p>“Now we can take it easy. We can follow more
leisurely&mdash;no trouble to follow the trail.”</p>

<p>There had been a shower and a wagon track through the
deep sand could be easily identified, and besides a horse
could not be driven at such a rattling gait as when on the
hard road.</p>

<p>The detective and Ike were soon in the woods and dense
brush, and it was a pretty hard walk through the sand,
and occasionally the detective would ask:</p>

<p>“Are you tired, lad?”</p>

<p>“No,” Ike would answer.</p>

<p>Thus they plodded along for about three hours, having
little difficulty in holding the track. Occasionally the<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
detective would draw his flashlight and examine the track,
and then they would push on.</p>

<p>It was just before midnight when they came to a place
where a house stood alone on a side lane, and the chances
were there was not another house within a mile in either
direction. The detective remarked:</p>

<p>“That man could have ridden in the cars to a nearer
station.”</p>

<p>“It is possible he had a motive,” said Ike.</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon he did, and now we can sit down and
rest, for there is the house down on Long Island that you
alluded to when working your ventriloquism.”</p>

<p>The two sat down on a fallen tree and the detective said:</p>

<p>“If your calculations prove correct, young fellow, your
fortune is made.”</p>

<p>“My calculations will all prove correct.”</p>

<p>“I believe they will. You certainly did calculate well
as to the movements of Fellman, and you have done so
well I’d like to know your idea of his scheme.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p>“Burlein is an open-hearted, trustful young man, to
begin with.”</p>

<p>“From what you say I think you are right.”</p>

<p>“Now, then, my idea is this: Possibly Fellman has
speculated with Burlein’s money or with the money of the
special partner, and he has gotten up this scheme to cover
his own guilt and put all the opprobrium on young Burlein.
That is one idea.”</p>

<p>“That is one idea?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You have another?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear all your ideas, my lad.”</p>

<p>“It is possible that Fellman loves the same girl, and<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
wants to blast Burlein’s character, and win her and her
fortune. That is my idea number two.”</p>

<p>“Now what is your third idea?”</p>

<p>Ike meditated a moment and then said:</p>

<p>“A bowler’s third ball is generally the surest.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I rather think my third idea is the one that will prove
correct. I’ve studied Fellman pretty well. He is not a
man to squander money. I believe he has put up a game
to rob Burlein and the special partner, and if it hadn’t
been for a lucky accident he would have succeeded.”</p>

<p>“Ike, I think your third ball is the sure one.”</p>

<p>“You believe it is a scheme of robbery?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How could he work it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he could hold poor Burlein a prisoner for years,
and in time kill him.”</p>

<p>“Then we are just in time to bust the game.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“He may attempt to remove Burlein.”</p>

<p>“All right, we will be on to all his movements. And
now you are pretty well rested?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“You are a bold lad.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am always ready to take chances in a good
cause.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you could get into that house?”</p>

<p>“Easy.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to try it?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“I’d go myself, but I believe you can work that end of
it better than I can.”</p>

<p>The two moved down toward the old house. Under the
shed was the buckboard, so they were assured that Fellman,
no matter what his game, had at least put up there for the<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
night. They were standing quite close to the fence surrounding
the house when Murray said:</p>

<p>“See there!”</p>

<p>A dark object was seen stealing toward them.</p>

<p>“It’s a Siberian,” said Ike.</p>

<p>“Hang the beast,” muttered Murray; “we will have to
betray ourselves in knocking him over.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it; just leave him to me.”</p>

<p>“Will you tackle that beast?”</p>

<p>“Will I? You just watch me, and don’t you have any
fear. I’ve got a good way for serving out doggies, big and
little.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot let you face that fellow.”</p>

<p>The dog had approached very leisurely, and he was an
immense fellow as he loomed up in the darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix him,” whispered Ike quickly. “You stand back.”</p>

<p>The dog came quite near and then suddenly, with a
growl and a snappish bark, leaped forward, and the next
instant Ike had him by the neck and turned him over on
his back. The great beast lay silent and helpless.</p>

<p>“Got a cord?” asked Ike.</p>

<p>The detective was amazed, but produced a strong cord
and Ike deliberately tied the great hound as a butcher ties
a calf for market. He had also bitted him so he could not
make any noise, and then rising and facing the detective
inquired:</p>

<p>“Well, how’s that?”</p>

<p>“Are you a human being?” demanded the officer.</p>

<p>“I am pretty human,” answered Ike.</p>

<p>“How did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s my way of serving out ugly doggies.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how you did it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, but I won’t show you. My master was
the greatest electrician that ever attempted to chain down
lightning. He made a machine for me&mdash;the only one in<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
the world. I can close my hands on anything living and
give them a shock that paralyzes them. I just paralyzed
the dog; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Could you paralyze a man?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so.”</p>

<p>Ike suddenly seized the detective by the two wrists and
the officer writhed and squirmed, and would have fallen
helpless on the sand had Ike not let up on him.</p>

<p>“Ike,” he exclaimed when released, “I’ll give you a
thousand dollars for that contrivance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain, but it is not for sale. I’ve got
out of too many bad scrapes with that little machine, and
I feared I had lost it when I was taken aboard the schooner;
but they didn’t search me, and I am all right.”</p>

<p>“Can I get one like it?”</p>

<p>“Not unless I break my promise. So your chances are
very slim, captain.”</p>

<p>“I reckon with that machine it’s safe to let you go in
the house.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it is.”</p>

<p>“What will I do while you’re gone if another dog starts
up?”</p>

<p>“Shoot, captain, shoot; that is all you can do. And
now for a go inside that house.”</p>

<p>Murray at Ike’s suggestion went around to the rear and
took up a position on the roof of a shed where he could lie
low and watch the house, and then our hero made his
attempt to enter. He encountered little difficulty. He
managed to get on the roof of one of the outbuildings. He
had seen a light in one of the rooms and knew that some
one was moving in the old house. He got in through an
attic window and moved cautiously toward the stairs leading
to the floors below. He got down one flight and
arrived opposite the room in which he had seen a light,
and in which, as he stole forward, he heard voices. He<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
peeped into the room and made a very startling discovery.
There were two men in the room. One was Fellman and
the other the banker’s exact counterpart. In fact, on the
instant Ike decided that number two was a twin brother.</p>

<p>The two men were sitting opposite each other and were
talking in a calm and easy manner. He heard Fellman
say:</p>

<p>“So your people have no suspicion?”</p>

<p>“None whatever.”</p>

<p>“They may find out you have a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“But suppose they should?”</p>

<p>“I will say it is an insane relative I am taking care of.”</p>

<p>“That might do, but the story will get out.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose it does. We can move him; but it will
be a long time before any one will find out I have a prisoner
here.”</p>

<p>“Where have you got him concealed?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t tell you?”</p>

<p>“As you please.”</p>

<p>“It is better that even you should not know. You may
talk in your sleep.”</p>

<p>“One question: suppose detectives should come out
here?”</p>

<p>“Let ’em come.”</p>

<p>“Are you certain they cannot pipe your prison?”</p>

<p>“I am dead certain. They could more easily find his
body were he in a secret grave.”</p>

<p>“Herman, I have reason to believe that I am suspected.”</p>

<p>“I thought when I saw you last that you said it was
impossible for you to be suspected, and that if I kept my
prisoner close it was not possible that you ever could be
suspected.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is what I thought, but since something
strange has occurred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Fellman told Herman what had occurred, and the latter
laughed and said:</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You have no fear. There are two ways to account for
what occurred. In the first place you are nervous. It
may be a freak of your own imagination.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! I am not a fool.”</p>

<p>“Then some man who thinks he is smart suspects, but
he has no evidence. No, you have nothing to fear, and
were they on your track they can never prove anything.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they should trail down to this place? Remember,
the question came: ‘Have you a place down on
Long Island?’”</p>

<p>“All right; let them come down here. It will do them
no good; indeed, it will relieve you of all further suspicion.
I’d advise you to invite them down here. I defy the devil
himself to find my prisoner.”</p>

<p>“How is he?”</p>

<p>“He takes it hard; between you and me, he will not
stand it long.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He will not stand it.”</p>

<p>“He will die?”</p>

<p>“He will.”</p>

<p>“And I will be a murderer.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You only made him a prisoner. He was
putting up a job on you and you defended yourself, that
is all. How about the money?”</p>

<p>“That end of it is all right.”</p>

<p>“How much do you receive?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve a right to know. It’s an even divide, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>Fellman fixed a queer look on his double, and his
co-conspirator.</p>

<p>“Do you mean treachery?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; nor do I mean to be the fool of any man.”</p>

<p>“I see now.”</p>

<p>“What do you see?”</p>

<p>“I know why you will not let me know where your
prisoner is concealed.”</p>

<p>“You make a mistake. I withhold the place of his
concealment as a matter of precaution only.”</p>

<p>Ike overheard every word that was spoken. Indeed he
thought he had overheard enough. He did not think it
was worth while to take any more chances at that time,
and he made his way out of the house and returned to
where the detective lay on the shed-roof. The two walked
off in the woods and Ike said:</p>

<p>“I had this thing all down correct. My third ball was
the true one.”</p>

<p>Ike related all that he had overheard&mdash;related it all word
for word, and when he had concluded the detective said:</p>

<p>“Well, lad, you have done a marvelous bit of detective
work. I can hardly realize that it is not all a romance,
and I am an old hand at the business.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We will go very slow.”</p>

<p>“But do not forget what Herman said about the young
man’s dying.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking of that.”</p>

<p>“Can we unearth his place of concealment?”</p>

<p>“Can we? Well, if we don’t we are a pair of ninnies,
that’s all. I am thinking how we had better proceed.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Go it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s find the young man and release him at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>“No, no; that will not do. I have a big rôle for you to
play.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play it well if I can, and next time I’ll play my
third ball first.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good scheme.”</p>

<p>“I shall return to New York in the morning, Ike.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“I will leave you here to watch Herman.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“You may get on to the young man’s prison place.”</p>

<p>“I may.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime I will arrange for a great close in on
Fellman. But there is one party I must see. We want
points.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to my end of it here. I’ll watch Mr.
Herman.”</p>

<p>The detective could not return until morning, and they
did not wish to remain in the vicinity of the house, so they
went off into the woods and found a shooting station on
the grounds of one of the great gun clubs, when Murray
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“By ginger, lad, I am acquainted with half the members
of that gun club, if we can only find their clubhouse.
Let’s try; we can get a good bed and a breakfast in the
morning.”</p>

<p>It was just a little after midnight when our hero and
the detective started to find the gun clubhouse, and they
were proceeding along talking in low tones and were in a
dense growth of brush and wood on the verge of a lake,
when suddenly both were brought to a stand, and paralyzed
for a moment by hearing a succession of unearthly yells.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried the detective, “some one is getting
murdered.” And he ran forward in the direction whence
the piercing screams had come. A little way on he came
to an opening where he halted and Ike joined him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Look there, lad.”</p>

<p>Ike did look, and just before them across an open space
of about a hundred yards was an old farmhouse, as it
appeared under the moonlight, for the clouds had rolled
away and the moon had come forth. On the porch of the
house sat four men, and as Ike and the detective appeared
there arose a wild chorus of laughter.</p>

<p>“It’s the clubhouse,” said Detective Murray.</p>

<p>“And one of the men gave the yells,” said Ike.</p>

<p>“Yes, the rascals have been drinking wine, and have
been shouting in their wild inebriety.”</p>

<p>Ike stood a moment considering, and finally said in a
pensive tone:</p>

<p>“I could give all those fellows the <em>horrors</em>.”</p>

<p>“You could?”</p>

<p>“I could.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, I know how.”</p>

<p>“It might do ’em good.”</p>

<p>“You know them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I recognize the voice of one of them.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to do him some good?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to say.”</p>

<p>“You can have some great fun to-night, captain, if you
want it.”</p>

<p>“I can?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’s your plan?”</p>

<p>“You go over there and join your friend. I won’t go,
but I’ll provide a great treat for you.”</p>

<p>Murray as a rule was a very serious sort of man, but he
had been a witness to a little of Ike’s marvelous powers,
and he did think it might be very amusing. But he said:</p>

<p>“It may be risky, Ike.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>“Those fellows always have their guns at hand. If anything
unusual should show up, they might take a notion
to shoot.”</p>

<p>“They will never shoot me. They will all think they
are ‘<em>called for</em>.’ What’s your friend’s name?”</p>

<p>“His name is Atwood.”</p>

<p>“Is he a married man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is his first name?”</p>

<p>“Tom.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of your man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“All right; go over and join them and prepare yourself
for the treat of your life. And your friend will get the
greatest scare of his life.”</p>

<p>“Don’t press it too hard, Ike.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll learn him a trick, you bet.”</p>

<p>Murray started across the opening and had proceeded
about fifty yards when the men on the porch espied him
and one of them cried:</p>

<p>“Hello, there’s a game thief, as sure as you are born.”</p>

<p>Up jumped the man and a moment later he reappeared
with his gun; but the steward ran out and caught the gun
away from him, and the detective, who had kept right on,
got near enough to call out:</p>

<p>“Hello, there!”</p>

<p>The men were up to mischief, and one of them
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, Atwood, there is your wife on the other end of
the telephone.”</p>

<p>The detective advanced and the four men approached
him, peering at him under the moonlight, and as he drew
nearer he called out:</p>

<p>“Hello, Atwood, old man! How are you?”</p>

<p>Atwood stared a moment and then asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize me?”</p>

<p>“No, but come and have a glass of wine all the same.
I know you are a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>The detective stepped on the piazza and Atwood grasped
him and dragged him into the house under the gaslight,
and then exclaimed, as he cordially shook the detective’s
hand:</p>

<p>“Why, Murray, you rascal! where on earth did you come
from? Here, have a glass of wine.”</p>

<p>The party were all pretty well under the influence of
wine, but none of them were too far over, only full of wine
and fun. Murray was not a drinking man as a rule, but
after his long walk he thought he would take one glass,
and he did so, and ate several sandwiches, as there were
quite a number on a plate.</p>

<p>“Well, old man, where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had business a little way over, and started to
walk to the depot, but lost my way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will stay here to-night.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got a good bed for you, old man.”</p>

<p>Atwood had introduced the detective all round, and the
men adjourned to the porch again and were all sitting there
enjoying their cigars when suddenly a scream was heard&mdash;a
scream resembling a female in great distress.</p>

<p>The men all started and after a moment inquired:</p>

<p>“What’s that? Did you hear it?”</p>

<p>They all heard it except Murray, who coolly asked:</p>

<p>“What is the matter, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” repeated Atwood; “why, didn’t
you hear it?”</p>

<p>“Hear what?”</p>

<p>“A woman’s scream.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>The detective laughed and said:</p>

<p>“Tom, I guess you’ve got ’em.”</p>

<p>“Got what?”</p>

<p>“Got ’em bad, old man.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you were the only man who heard anything,
Tom.”</p>

<p>The others of the party began to laugh. They wanted
to make out they didn’t hear, and at any rate they were
prepared to make it merry for Atwood. All hands protested
they had not heard anything, and finally Atwood said:</p>

<p>“You are all deaf and dumb with wine. Hang it, it
was a wild cat I heard as plain as though I had stepped on
its tail.”</p>

<p>“I guess you did, Atty, old boy,” said Murray.</p>

<p>The men resumed their seats and were talking over the
scream Tom Atwood had heard, when suddenly there came
a voice, as though some one stood in the doorway of the
cottage, and the voice appeared like a groan. All the men
heard the groans and they appeared a little bit dazed, and
one of them said:</p>

<p>“By ginger, gentlemen, it looks to me as though the
ghosts had come back.”</p>

<p>“Is the house haunted?” asked Murray.</p>

<p>“Is it? Well, I’ll tell you. This house was built in old
colonial times. Several people were murdered in this house
by the Indians and it is said that during the revolutionary
war a crew from a pirate schooner made a raid here and
killed a beautiful young lady. You can see now where a
tomahawk stuck, and also the hole where a bullet lodged.
In fact, before we made our alterations here there were
bullet marks to be seen all over the house.”</p>

<p>“Has it ever been reported to be haunted?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and no one would live here, and we bought the
place cheap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>“It would appear that the stories about its being haunted
are confirmed.”</p>

<p>Even while the men were talking the groans were heard
again, and one of the party said:</p>

<p>“Hang it, I don’t want to sleep in that house to-night.
I’ll sling a hammock out here under the trees.”</p>

<p>Atwood spoke up and said:</p>

<p>“I’ll sleep in the house, you bet. I ain’t going to take
the chances of pneumonia because I fear a few walking
apparitions.”</p>

<p>Tom Atwood appeared to be very brave and Murray said:</p>

<p>“It is a ghost, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, I like ghosts.”</p>

<p>“And you are going to sleep in the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>One of the party suggested:</p>

<p>“Suppose we all sleep out here and let Tom sleep in the
house all alone by himself.”</p>

<p>“All right,” came the unanimous response.</p>

<p>Murray said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom is only pretending. He daren’t sleep in the
house alone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you fifty I dare.”</p>

<p>Murray was startled at this instant when a voice sounded
close to his ear saying, “Take the bet.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet fifty I dare sleep in the house all alone.”</p>

<p>We will here state that the steward of the club and his
little family occupied a little rear house. The main building
was reserved exclusively for the club members.</p>

<p>“You’ll bet fifty you sleep in the house alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you, Atwood,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“And I’ll take you for fifty,” called another of the
party, and still another offered to take the bet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>Atwood accepted every bet, and in the meantime no
more sounds had been heard. But the moment the bets
were all arranged again there came a renewal of the groans.</p>

<p>“That’s a ghost, sure,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, but as it is the ghost of a pretty woman Tom is
glad to sleep alone in the house. He always had an eye
for beauty and he thinks he’ll catch a glimpse of the ghost.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll catch a hundred and fifty dollars of you
fellows’ money,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You’re dead sure of that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll press the bet,” said the detective, “and make it a
hundred you don’t sleep in the house from two a.m. until
daylight.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>The men sat there discussing the remarkable sounds.
Tom Atwood, as it was afterward learned, had been
informed that when the wind came from a certain direction
pretty strange sounds were often heard. He did not tell
the latter fact to his companions, but let them talk and
wonder what it all meant, and congratulated himself upon
his easy winning of two hundred dollars, and he said:</p>

<p>“I did not know you fellows were so superstitious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are awful brave.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to take a few more bets.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you a basket,” said Murray.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it, old man. You appear to think I am afraid
of ghosts.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t slept in the house yet, whether you are
afraid of ghosts or not.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will lay around out here until near
daylight.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Go to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go.” But at that instant there came a
scream. It appeared to come from some one standing
right in the doorway of the cottage. The door was in the
center of the house, and the men were seated on either side
of it.</p>

<p>“Go in and go to bed,” said Murray.</p>

<p>Tom, however, was a little shaky. There was something
fearfully human in the sound of that voice, although
very uncanny.</p>

<p>“Go in, Tom,” urged Murray, and the man made a step
toward the door, when a voice demanded:</p>

<p>“Tom! Tom Atwood! is that you, and is this the way
<em>you come down to the club for rest</em>?”</p>

<p>Tom Atwood’s hair almost stood on end. He recoiled
and glared, and Murray called out:</p>

<p>“Hello! That’s the voice of a ghost from New York.
You lose the bets, Tom. You’re working a fraud on us.
You didn’t mean to sleep alone in that house, you rascal.”</p>

<p>The other men called out:</p>

<p>“Well, this is a nice scheme, old man. You didn’t tell
us Mrs. Atwood was coming down.”</p>

<p>Tom made no answer, but just stood, not like one gazing
upon an apparition, but like a man confronted by a more
frightful reality, and we will explain.</p>

<p>Tom Atwood was at home a professed temperance man,
and when he went down to the club he generally made up
for his total abstinence during his sojourn at home. His
wife, as was well known, was a hater of strong drink, and
Tom pretended to strictly conform to her prejudices, and he
stood there paralyzed, believing his wife had suspected him
and had paid a secret visit to the club to find him out.
Indeed, instead of playing a fraud on his fellow members
he suspected they were putting up a little job on him, and
that they were all aware of the presence of his wife in the
house, and after he thought he knew why they had all been<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
so liberal in “setting ’em up” until he got full as a
tick.</p>

<p>“Go in, Tom,” said Murray.</p>

<p>When the detective spoke to him the man decided that
he could solve the mystery. He could not only account
for the presence of his wife, but the presence of the detective
down at the club was accounted for, and with an oath
he said:</p>

<p>“Murray, I’ll get square with you.”</p>

<p>“Come in here, Tom,” called a voice.</p>

<p>“Follow the ghost,” cried all the men, who lost all their
terror and began to think the whole thing was a huge joke.</p>

<p>“Come in, Tom,” said the voice.</p>

<p>Tom looked around helplessly at his companions and
then entered the house, saying:</p>

<p>“All right, Mary, I’m coming.”</p>

<p>He did go in the house, and the men followed to peep
at him and hear him get a good tongue lashing; but in a
few moments Atwood came back to the stoop looking like
a ghost himself. The sweat was pouring down his face as
he said in a distressed tone:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, this is no joke. On my honor, no one is
in that house. What does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, your wife is playing hide and seek on you,” said
one.</p>

<p>“She is dodging you, old man; she’s here.”</p>

<p>Atwood walked over to Murray and said:</p>

<p>“Murray, you are my friend.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“You will tell me the truth?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Did my wife come down here with you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that she is here?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“You will swear to that?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Atwood’s face assumed the hue of death. A bright
light shone out from the hall of the cottage. The man
stood right before the opening and his features were fully
revealed. He presented a pitiable sight, for he was a good
fellow and very fond of his wife, and a weird suspicion had
penetrated his mind.</p>

<p>Again he addressed Murray saying:</p>

<p>“You would not deceive me?”</p>

<p>“On my honor I wouldn’t, Tom.”</p>

<p>“And my wife did not come down here with you?”</p>

<p>“She did not.”</p>

<p>“And you do not know that she is really here?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“Boys, I am going to New York,” said Atwood. “Going
if I walk every step of the way.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a voice again. It sounded
right from the doorway as before, and it called another of
the men by name.</p>

<p>We will here state that Ike, the wonder, had learned the
names of all the men, and he made up his mind to let up
on Tom Atwood and work one or two of the others, and
when the name of number two was called the man leaped
to his feet. He was a violent fellow when aroused. His
gun was standing near and he cried out:</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot that ghost, living or dead.”</p>

<p>The whole party made up their minds that a trick was
being played. The man, Bill, ran into the house and
looked all around, but came out without having found
any one.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” he said, “this has gone far enough.
Let’s sift it to the bottom.”</p>

<p>All hands agreed, and it was arranged that one man
should stand at the front door, another at the rear, and<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
that three others should go through the house from room
to room, guns in hand, and solve the mystery.</p>

<p>The plan was put in execution. One man went to a
closet, opened the door and fell back glaring in horror, for
he was met by a scream right in his ears which came from
the closet. In the meantime one of the other men had
opened the wine-room door and he too encountered a soul-thrilling
scream. He ran shouting away, and the third
man also had an experience which caused him to rush out
to the balcony.</p>

<p>The mystery had not been solved. It was deeper than
ever, and the men were all greatly excited when Murray
asked coolly:</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you fellows?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear the voice?” asked one.</p>

<p>“No, I hear no voice.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, I hear no ghostly voice such as you fellows are all
jabbering about.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t strange. You’ve all got ’em. What kind
of whiskey do you keep here anyhow? Here you are going
on like a lot of madmen. Take my advice, go in and take
a big glass of Appollinaris, and take a little nervine. I tell
you, boys, you’ve all got ’em, and you’ve got ’em bad,
too.”</p>

<p>The men did go in and drink Vichy, and the steward,
who had been summoned, produced some valerian and they
all took big doses and calmed down. The voice was not
heard again, and it became the mystery of their lives. Indeed
they all believed they “had ’em.” They were told it
had been a temporary epidemic of snake seeing, and the
evidence to each was so strong they were mystified, and
inclined to believe it. It was not until weeks afterward
that Murray undeceived them, and then he disclosed the<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
truth to Tom Atwood, who was so deeply affected he
became melancholy over it.</p>

<p>Murray determined to go to bed after the men had
quieted down, and he let Ike in at the window of his room
and put him to bed. At an early hour the lad was out
and around, and at the breakfast he appeared as a lad who
brought a message to the detective. The latter invited
him to breakfast and then disclosed the fact that Ike was
at work on a clew for him, and secured the privilege of
bed and lodgment for the boy during such time as he
remained there. He also bid Ike not to attempt any more
pranks for the time being.</p>

<p>Later Murray went to New York. On the same train
was the man Fellman, and Murray had a chance to study
his man all the way down on the train.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the officer in New York he went direct
to the office of the gentleman, Mr. Smith, who was a
special partner in the banking business, and who was the
father of the beautiful girl whom it is known young Burlein
was affianced to.</p>

<p>The detective was shown into the merchant’s private
office, and after seating himself said:</p>

<p>“I have come here, sir, on very important business.”</p>

<p>“Your name, sir.”</p>

<p>The detective passed over his card, and as it happened
Mr. Smith had heard of the officer and consequently was
prepared to listen to him.</p>

<p>“I wish to ask you a few questions, sir, and I trust you
will answer me freely and truly, and when I am through
questioning you I have some very startling intelligence to
impart.”</p>

<p>“I will answer you, sir, as far as I can.”</p>

<p>“What amount have you, as a special partner, invested
in the firm of Fellman &amp; Co.”</p>

<p>“A quarter of a million.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>“What do you know about Fellman?”</p>

<p>“Very little. I invested in the concern because young
Burlein had been in my employ from boyhood, previous to
his going into Wall street.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have known him pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How much money did he have of his own?”</p>

<p>“About fifty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“How much money did Fellman have in the business?”</p>

<p>“He had very little save his great experience as a banker.
He was to have put money in, but for some reason he could
not dispose of his securities, and I think he had but little
cash in the concern.”</p>

<p>“What is the present condition of the business?”</p>

<p>“Every dollar is lost.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“We have every reason to believe by outside speculations
on the part of poor Alfred.”</p>

<p>“And is there any indebtedness?”</p>

<p>“No, I am the greatest loser.”</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose tempted young Burlein?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I believed him the soul of honor, and
he was a very cautious young man. It was the surprise of
my life. He was to have married my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Have you made an investigation of the affairs?”</p>

<p>“No, I have pocketed my loss, as the saying goes.”</p>

<p>“And you have accepted the statement of Fellman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as Alfred has run away or destroyed himself,
I am compelled to accept his statement.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever strike you, sir, that Fellman might be a
villain?”</p>

<p>“I know but little about him.”</p>

<p>“And yet you did know young Burlein?”</p>

<p>“I thought I did.”</p>

<p>“You never saw anything in his conduct that would<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
lead you to suspect that he could have acted as it appears
he has done?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Fellman is a villain. Young Burlein is an honest man,
and his victim. Not one penny was ever lost or squandered
by the junior partner.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith started and gazed at the officer with a look
of pleasant amazement upon his face. His look of pleasure
deepened as the detective proceeded and unfolded his wonderful
discoveries and told the story of Nimble Ike.</p>

<p>When the narrative was completed Mr. Smith had his
points. He expressed his delight, and further said:</p>

<p>“When this matter is all concluded I will take care of
this little fellow, Isaac.”</p>

<p>The detective’s interview with the great capitalist lasted
several hours, and when it was concluded the detective
started for the country.</p>

<p>On the same day that Murray visited the capitalist the
latter, in company with his lawyer, called upon Fellman.
They found the man walking up and down his office with
an expression of great satisfaction upon his face; but there
followed a look of consternation when the special partner
announced the object of his visit, and the rogue Fellman
received the first intimation that his cunning scheme of
robbery was not going to prove such an easy and successful
venture as he supposed.</p>

<p>While the events which we have described were transpiring
in New York, Ike was working his end of it down
at the house on Long Island. The boy discovered a cunning
and ingenuity that were really marvelous. He had
telegraphed a certain request to the detective and then
continued his “piping” for facts.</p>

<p>That evening Detective Murray arrived. He met Ike<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
near the clubhouse and the lad discovered that his friend
had brought a magnificent hound with him.</p>

<p>“I got your telegram, Ike,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“I have brought one of the best hounds ever raised in
this country&mdash;an animal trained to trailing human beings.”</p>

<p>“We will have use for him. This man, Herman Fellman,
is a daring and cunning man, and I have made a most
startling discovery. He intends to murder his prisoner in
cold blood. I’ve been close on his track. He is a man
who talks to himself, and I overheard him muttering, and
from what he said I am sure he intends to do away with
young Burlein, and I believe he intends to do it to-night.”</p>

<p>“We can get into the house and watch him.”</p>

<p>“No need. He has several children, besides his wife.
They are all trained in villainy. We will never discover
anything by watching him, simply because the man would
evade us, do away with his victim and then defy us. We
could get the proof against him and hang him, but hanging
that fellow would not bring Burlein back to life.”</p>

<p>“Ike,” said Murray, “you are a born detective.”</p>

<p>“I may become one. I’ve been thinking the matter
over pretty seriously.”</p>

<p>“You can go in with me, lad.”</p>

<p>“We will talk that matter over later. What we want to
do now is to release Burlein.”</p>

<p>“You have a plan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a plan, and it is to go about it in the most
direct manner.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose?”</p>

<p>“I propose to take possession of that house and then go
to work at our leisure. I am certain Burlein is concealed
somewhere within a hundred yards of that old ramshackle
building. You and I can find out the secret with the aid
of your dog there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>“Suppose we fail?”</p>

<p>“We can’t fail, or in other words we won’t fail; but one
thing is certain. We must find Burlein alive before midnight
or it will be a search for a dead man, for I tell you
that scoundrel has decided to murder him&mdash;yes, murder
him to-night.”</p>

<p>“And you propose we take possession of the house?”</p>

<p>“I do; and we will make prisoners of every one in the
building. Then we will set the dog to work and with his
aid we will find that secret prison, or to-morrow it will be
a grave.”</p>

<p>“At what hour shall we start in?”</p>

<p>“We will go down there at nine o’clock. We will go as
tramps. We will ask shelter. We will be refused, then
we can provoke him into a row, and quicker than lightning
close in on every member of the family.”</p>

<p>Murray meditated for a long time and then said:</p>

<p>“I reckon your scheme is a good one.”</p>

<p>We will here explain that Murray had disclosed to
Atwood the mystery of the strange noises. The effect
upon the man had been so marked the officer thought it
best to relieve his mind, and after dinner our hero amused
the two or three men present from the city by giving them
some very remarkable exhibitions of his skill as a magician
and a ventriloquist, and all hands pronounced him the
wonder of the age.</p>

<p>At a little after eight o’clock Murray and our hero
started for the farmhouse and in due time arrived there.
The man Herman was sitting on the piazza. He was a
powerful fellow&mdash;a great ignorant lout, but undoubtedly,
as the detective concluded, physically as strong as a horse,
and a man just ignorant enough in a violent passion to kill
a man. If there was a born murderer in appearance the
fellow Herman was the man.</p>

<p>Murray and Ike approached the house. The hound had<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
been left under a hedge and as the two apparent tramps
drew near Herman warned them off; but the pretended
“cheese eaters” would not obey, but walked straight up to
the porch.</p>

<p>“What do you rascals want?” demanded Herman.</p>

<p>“We are tired and hungry; we want food and lodging.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get it here.”</p>

<p>“Will you turn us away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>

<p>“All right, we will sit down on your stoop awhile and
rest, and you will sell us a glass of milk.”</p>

<p>“I will sell you nothing, and you cannot sit down on my
stoop. Be off with you.”</p>

<p>Murray sat down and Ike followed suit. The owner of
the cottage rose to his feet, his face red with rage and his
eyes blazing:</p>

<p>“Did you hear me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we heard you.”</p>

<p>“Go off.”</p>

<p>“We are comfortable here.”</p>

<p>The man, who as stated was a powerful fellow, made a
spring at Murray, when quick as lightning the old timer
dealt him a blow with a billy that brought him to his
knees. He shouted murder, but the next instant the
darbies were on him, and then he wilted and became quiet,
and in less time than it takes to tell it the rest of the
family were secured and dragged into the house.</p>

<p>Murray uttered a whistle and the hound came bounding
forward. The well-trained animal had waited for his
signal with the seeming intelligence of a human being.</p>

<p>The detective let the dog smell a hat which he had
brought with him and gave the command:</p>

<p>“Go find.”</p>

<p>We could fill a book with accounts of extraordinary displays
of sagacity by dogs, and the detective had an animal<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
as intelligent as any beast ever started on a scent. The
great brute scented around for a few moments and then
scratched at a door leading down to the cellar, and once
below he scented and scented, searching here and there,
and for a long time appeared to be at fault; and the detective
remarked to Ike, who stood by with a mask lantern in
his hand:</p>

<p>“He’s lost the trail, Ike.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he is only doubtful, that’s all. He is on the
trail, just a little perplexed. He’ll get there; you give
him time.”</p>

<p>“You talk as though you knew the dog.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve been watching him. I know their habits,
and I tell you he’s just bothered a little, but you trust a
hound like him to untangle. He’ll get there, you can
bet.”</p>

<p>A little time and it appeared as though Ike had measured
the dog just right, for the animal went round and
round, his nose almost rubbing against the stone wall lining
the cellar, and every time he came to a certain spot he
would stop and scent more particularly and then go around
again, and then Ike said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Murray, the dog has accomplished all that instinct
can do. Human intelligence must go to his aid now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Ike.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. Call off the dog.”</p>

<p>Murray called off the hound and Ike went to the spot
where the animal had made his stop. He flashed his light
on the wall and only the ordinary surface that can be seen
in any stone wall was apparently presented, and Ike said:</p>

<p>“I am bothered as well as the dog.”</p>

<p>“I fear we’ll be compelled to torture that fellow upstairs
into a confession.”</p>

<p>“He will never confess, you could kill him first. I know
his breed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>Ike took a stick of wood and knocked on the wall and
listened carefully, and suddenly he bent his head down
and listened more acutely. Finally he picked up a spade
lying near by and commenced to pick at the mortar until
at length he ejaculated:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, we’ve got it.”</p>

<p>He worked away and soon had a stone removed and a
passage&mdash;a very small passage&mdash;was disclosed. There was
not room for a man to pass through, but a child could.</p>

<p>“You stay here,” said Ike. “I’ll crawl.”</p>

<p>“Look out, lad; let me test the air. You do not know
what you are doing.”</p>

<p>The detective drew a candle from his pocket, lit it and
thrust it in the opening. Ike watched, and after a
moment said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” and commenced to crawl in.</p>

<p>The detective drew his pistol and stood guard at the
opening, and he was compelled to hold his hound by main
force, for the animal sought to crawl in after Ike, and the
latter fact established to a certainty that the prisoner was
not far off.</p>

<p>Ike crawled along and finally came to an opening. He
thrust his lamp forward, and a sight met his gaze that for
an instant almost paralyzed him. There before him,
stretched upon a clammy bottom in a mess of straw, lay
the body of a man, and Ike decided that it was upon a
dead body he was gazing and cold chills ran through his
heart as he muttered:</p>

<p>“The scoundrels have murdered him and hidden his
body here.”</p>

<p>Even as the lad spoke, however, the apparently dead
man moved and Ike called out:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Alfred Burlein?”</p>

<p>A pale-faced man&mdash;so pale that he looked like a moving
corpse&mdash;half rose and glanced toward the spot whence the<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
voice came. Ike flashed the light in his face and recognized
young Burlein, and called out:</p>

<p>“It’s all right. I am here.”</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded the poor prisoner in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>“The little fraud who tried to knock you out of another
tenner.”</p>

<p>Even as our hero uttered the words he mentally added:
“I said I’d get those words back on him.”</p>

<p>Ike got into the place and soon released young Burlein,
who had been bound and strapped to a stake driven far
down in the soil.</p>

<p>Burlein attempted to ask questions, but Ike said:</p>

<p>“No time to explain now. We’ve got to get you out of
here.”</p>

<p>The lad made an examination of the surroundings and
finally reached the conclusion that it was an old cistern,
an old ice house, or possibly an old vault. Evidently it
had been closed from without and Herman had made the
entrance through which Ike had come.</p>

<p>“How did he get you in here?” asked Ike. “He never
carried you through that entrance.”</p>

<p>“No, he let me down from the top and then closed the
entrance over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Well, that is the way we will get you out.”</p>

<p>Our hero left his lantern with Burlein and crawled back
and reported. Then he with Murray’s aid located the side
of the wall, fixed the distance with the two outer corners,
and then went out again. They located the point above
where the opening terminated in the cellar, and then
paced the distance, and soon dug down to the trap cover.
Finding a ladder they descended and a little later Burlein
was raised to the open air. His strength quickly returned
and he was able to walk with the detective and our hero
over to the clubhouse. On the way he explained that the
little food he had received had been brought to him by a
child who had crawled through the same opening by which
Ike had crept.</p>

<p>Explanations followed all round and Burlein could not
find words to express his gratitude to our little hero, who
was reluctant to listen to the words of praise and thanks
that were showered upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>The following morning the detective took the town
constable with him and went over to the farmhouse and
carefully examined with Ike the ingenious methods the
man Herman had adopted to hide the two entrances to the
old vault, and even Murray admitted that if it had not
been for Ike’s persistent confidence he would have been
baffled.</p>

<p>The man Herman was placed under guard, the constable
and the gamekeeper from the club standing guard, and on
the very first train Murray, our hero and Burlein started
for New York.</p>

<p>Burlein went direct to his rooms, all hands agreeing to
meet at Mr. Smith’s office at eleven o’clock. At the time
named all hands were there. Murray had gone earlier and
had explained the startling discoveries to the merchant.
At eleven o’clock, as stated, the parties all met in the
banker’s office and were stowed away in a little inner room,
and a little later Fellman arrived with his counsel, all
shysters well known around New York.</p>

<p>After a little preliminary talk Mr. Smith said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Fellman, I am not wholly satisfied with your
statement.”</p>

<p>The shysters spoke for Fellman and in an independent
tone said:</p>

<p>“That is for your own discomfort, sir. We are not responsible
for the acts of the scoundrel who not only swindled
you but my innocent and confiding client, Mr. Fellman.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not satisfied,” said Mr. Smith, “and I wish
a gentleman in whom I have much confidence to exchange
a few words with you.”</p>

<p>A moment later Murray entered the office and addressing
the lawyer who was acting for Fellman said:</p>

<p>“How far, sir, are you implicated in this fraud?”</p>

<p>“How dare you?” fumed the lawyer.</p>

<p>Murray showed his badge.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” ejaculated the lawyer with a sneer. “You
wish to scare us, eh? You mean to bulldoze us&mdash;blackmail
us.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t answer my question.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I repudiate the insinuations of fraud in behalf
of my client.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Murray gave a signal and Alfred Burlein entered the
room. If a ghost had stalked in the effect could not have
been more striking. Fellman and his lawyer both looked
like ghosts.</p>

<p>Murray again addressed Fellman’s lawyer.</p>

<p>“You are his counsel?”</p>

<p>“Well, he called me in, but I did not understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, you are prepared to desert a sinking ship.
That’s all right, you can clear decks first, though. And
now here is a proposition: Fellman is to confess, make
restitution and leave the country with his brother in forty-eight
hours or take the consequences of several of the most
daring crimes. What will he do?”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at his client and the latter asked:</p>

<p>“Am I to be permitted to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, simply because I believe it better to have scoundrels
like you and yours out of the country&mdash;better than to have
you in jail, for you might come forth and commit greater
crimes.”</p>

<p>“We accept your offer,” said the lawyer, after a few
moments’ conference with his trembling client.</p>

<p>The settlement was made, and within forty-eight hours
Fellman, with his brother Herman and the latter’s family,
sailed away from New York forever.</p>

<p>Ike was well rewarded and Mr. Smith offered to take
him into his business and make a merchant of him, but
our hero answered:</p>

<p>“No, sir; I thank you, but I am going to become a
detective.”</p>

<p>Ike returned to Mrs. Pell. He had made money and he
provided a nice little home, and his prospects were brilliant
under an arrangement he made with Detective Murray, to
whom he had demonstrated not only his remarkable skill
as a ventriloquist but also his more than wonderful keenness
in detective work.</p>

<p>Our story is complete. But in the near future we propose
in a new story to relate the wonderful adventures of
Nimble Ike as a detective, wherein, as Detective Murray’s
aid, he performed detective feats in which he utilized his
wonderful gift and his extraordinary intelligence.</p>

<p>We have put up and sold this article for over sixty years, and can say in confidence
and truth of it what we have never been able to say of any other medicine:
never has it failed in a single instance to effect a cure when timely used.
Never did we know an instance of dissatisfaction by any one who used it. On
the contrary, all are delighted with its operations, and speak in terms of highest
commendation of its magical effects and <span class="sansseriffont"><b><em>medical virtues</em></b></span>. We
speak in this matter “what we do know” after years of experience, and pledge
our reputation for the fulfillment of what we here declare. In almost every instance,
where the infant is suffering from pain and exhaustion, relief will be
found in fifteen or twenty minutes after the syrup is administered.</p>

<p>This valuable preparation has been <span class="sansseriffont"><b><em>used with never-failing
success in thousands of cases</em></b></span>. It not only relieves the child
from pain, but</p>

<p class="center xlargefont sansseriffont"><em><b>Invigorates the Stomach and Bowels</b></em>.</p>

<p>MRS. WINSLOW’S SOOTHING SYRUP corrects acidity and gives
tone and energy to the whole system. It will almost instantly relieve griping
in the bowels and wind colic. We believe it <span class="sansseriffont"><b><em>the best and surest

<p class="center xlargefont sansseriffont"><em><b>Diarrhœa In Children</b></em>,</p>

<p>whether arising from teething or any other cause.</p>

<p>We would say to every mother who has a child suffering from any of the
foregoing complaints, do not let your prejudices, nor the prejudices of others,
stand between your suffering child and the relief that will be sure&mdash;yes, absolutely
sure&mdash;to follow the use of this medicine if timely used. Full directions
for using will accompany each bottle. <span class="smcap">Twenty-five Cents a Bottle.</span></p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
